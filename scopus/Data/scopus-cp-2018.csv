In this work we start from simple non-relational knowledge that can be extracted from text by considering the co-occurrence of entities inside textual corpora; we show that we can easily integrate this knowledge with Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs), a neuro-symbolic model. Using LTNs it is possible to integrate axioms and facts with commonsense knowledge represented in a sub-symbolic form in one single model performing well in reasoning tasks. In spite of some current limitations, we show that results are promising. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,"Computer programming languages; Commonsense knowledge; Current fields; Current limitation; Logical reasoning; Reasoning tasks; Single models; Symbolic integration; Symbolic model; Deep learning","Bach, S.H., Broecheler, M., Huang, B., Getoor, L., Hinge-loss markov random fields and probabilistic soft logic (2017) J.

The integration of effective relational learning and reasoning methods is one of the key challenges in this direction, as neural learning and symbolic reasoning offer complementary characteristics that can benefit the development of AI systems. Relational labelling or link prediction on knowledge graphs has become one of the main problems in deep learning-based natural language processing research. Moreover, other fields which make use of neural-symbolic techniques may also benefit from such research endeavours. There have been several efforts towards the identification of missing facts from existing ones in knowledge graphs. Two lines of research try and predict knowledge relations between two entities by considering all known facts connecting them or several paths of facts connecting them. We propose a neural-symbolic graph neural network which applies learning over all the paths by feeding the model with the embedding of the minimal subset of the knowledge graph containing such paths. By learning to produce representations for entities and facts corresponding to word embeddings, we show how the model can be trained end-to-end to decode these representations and infer relations between entities in a multitask approach. Our contribution is two-fold: a neural-symbolic methodology leverages the resolution of relational inference in large graphs, and we also demonstrate that such neural-symbolic model is shown more effective than path-based approaches. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Graph neural networks; Neural-symbolic computing; Relational learning","Deep learning; Embeddings; Graph theory; Knowledge representation; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Complementary characteristics; Graph neural networks; NAtural language processing; Relational inferences; Relational learning; Relational reasoning; Symbolic reasoning; Symbolic techniques; Neural networks","Battaglia, P., (2018) Relational Inductive Biases, Deep Learning, and Graph Networks, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Bordes, A., Usunier, N., García-Durán, A., Weston, J., Yakhnenko, O., Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data (2013) Proceedings of NIPS, pp. 2787-2795; Brockschmidt, M., Allamanis, M., Gaunt, A.L., Polozov, O., (2018) Generative Code Modeling with Graphs; Das, R., Neelakantan, A., Belanger, D., McCallum, A., Chains of reasoning over entities, relations, and text using recurrent neural networks (2017) Proceedings of EACL, pp. 132-141. , 2017; Evans, R., Grefenstette, E., Learning explanatory rules from noisy data (2018) J.

In this paper, we present a commonsense approach that utilizes an interpretable hybrid neural-symbolic system to associate extracted targets, noun chunks determined to be associated with the expressed emotion, with affective labels from a natural language expression. We leverage a pre-trained neural network that is well adapted to tree and sub-tree processing, the Dependency Tree-LSTM, to learn the affect labels of dynamic targets, determined through symbolic rules, in natural language. We find that making use of the unique properties of the recursive network provides higher accuracy and interpretability when compared to other unstructured and sequential methods for determining target-affect associations in an aspect-based sentiment analysis task. © 2019 IEEE.","affective computing; hybrid; natural language processing; neural-symbolic; recursive; sentiment","Deep learning; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Sentiment analysis; Affective Computing; hybrid; NAtural language processing; neural-symbolic; recursive; sentiment; Long short-term memory","Lim, A., Okuno, H.G., A recipe for empathy (2015) International Journal of Social Robotics, 7 (1), pp. 35-49; Poria, S., Cambria, E., Bajpai, R., Hussain, A., A review of affective computing: From unimodal analysis to multimodal fusion (2017) Information Fusion, 37, pp. 98-125; Hochreiter, S., Schmidhuber, J., Long short-term memory (1997) Neural Computation, 9 (8), pp. 1735-1780; Cambria, E., Olsher, D., Rajagopal, D., Senticnet 3: A common and common-sense knowledge base for cognition-driven sentiment analysis (2014) Twenty-eighth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Poria, S., Cambria, E., Winterstein, G., Huang, G., Sentic patterns: Dependency-based rules for concept-level sentiment analysis (2014) Knowledge-Based Systems, 69, pp. 45-63; Sheng Tai, K., Socher, R., Manning, C.D., (2015) Improved Semantic Representations from Tree-structured Long Short-term Memory Networks; Poria, S., Chaturvedi, I., Cambria, E., Bisio, F., Sentic lda: Improving on lda with semantic similarity for aspect-based sentiment analysis (2016) Neural Networks (IJCNN), 2016 International Joint Conference on, pp. 4465-4473. , IEEE; He, R., Sun Lee, W., Tou Ng, H., Dahlmeier, D., An unsupervised neural attention model for aspect extraction (2017) Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1, pp. 388-397; Hazarika, D., Poria, S., Vij, P., Krishnamurthy, G., Cambria, E., Zimmermann, R., Modeling inter-aspect dependencies for aspect-based sentiment analysis (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, 2, pp. 266-270. , Short Papers), 2; Ma, Y., Peng, H., Cambria, E., Targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis via embedding commonsense knowledge into an attentive lstm (2018) Proceedings of AAAI; Cambria, E., Hussain, A., (2015) Sentic Computing: A Commonsense- Based Framework for Concept-level Sentiment Analysis, 1. , Springer; Buechel, S., Hahn, U., Emobank: Studying the impact of annotation perspective and representation format on dimensional emotion analysis (2017) Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2, pp. 578-585. , Short Papers; Siqueira, H., Sutherland, A., Barros, P., Kerzel, M., Magg, S., Wermter, S., Disambiguating affective stimulus associations for robot perception and dialogue (2018) IEEERAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids), pp. 433-440. , Nov; Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Papageorgiou, H., Androutsopoulos, I., Manandhar, S., Mohammad, A., Al-Ayyoub, M., De Clercq, O., Semeval-2016 task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis (2016) Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016), pp. 19-30; Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C.D., Ng, A., Potts, C., Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 1631-1642; Kim, Y., (2014) Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification; Schuff, H., Barnes, J., Mohme, J., Padó, S., Klinger, R., Annotation, modelling and analysis of fine-grained emotions on a stance and sentiment detection corpus (2017) Proceedings of the 8th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, pp. 13-23; Byrd, R.H., Lu, P., Nocedal, J., Zhu, C., A limited memory algorithm for bound constrained optimization (1995) SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 16 (5), pp. 1190-1208; Pennington, J., Socher, R., Manning, C., Glove: Global vectors for word representation (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1532-1543; Pavlenko, A., Emotions and the body in Russian and english (2002) Pragmatics & Cognition, 10 (1), pp. 207-241",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2019","14 July 2019 through 19 July 2019",,152291,"Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073214635

Recent work has developed the notion of a context-dependant generative policy framework capable of learning generative policy models from strings and text-based data in a tabular format. However, it is vital that unstructured contextual information can be analysed alongside tabular data, potentially at the edge of the network to enable generative policy models to be applied to more complex tasks. This paper performs a deep-dive into the field of neuralsymbolic machine learning with a view towards enabling future neural-symbolic generative policy models that are capable of analysing both structured and unstructured data, whilst providing full transparency and enabling edge of network reasoning capability. Firstly, an existing technique called DeepProbLog is investigated and applied to a policy inferencing task based on unstructured data and secondly, a recent inductive logic programming technique currently used for learning generative policy models is evaluated with respect to a policy learning task also based on unstructured data. Finally, the results of both tasks are discussed to provide a platform for future research into enabling neural-symbolic generative policy models. © 2019 IEEE.","Distributed Analytics; Generative Policy Models; Information Science; Neural-Symbolic Learning","Big data; Data Sharing; Inductive logic programming (ILP); Information science; Object oriented programming; Contextual information; Distributed Analytics; Distributed environments; Information sharing; Policy model; Reasoning capabilities; Symbolic learning; Unstructured data; Learning systems","Verma, D., Calo, S., Chakraborty, S., Bertino, E., Williams, C., Tucker, J., Rivera, B., Generative policy model for autonomic management (2017) 2017 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence Computing, Advanced Trusted Computed, Scalable Computing Communications, Cloud Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (Smart-World/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI), pp. 1-6. , Aug; Calo, S., Manotas, I., De Mel, G., Cunnington, D., Law, M., Verma, D., Russo, A., Bertino, E., AGENP: An ASGrammar-based GENerative policy framework (2019) Policy-Based Autonomic Data Governance, pp. 3-20. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-17277-0\1, Springer, Sep; Law, M., Russo, A., Elisa, B., Krysia, B., Jorge, L., Representing and learning grammars in answer set programming (2019) AAAI; Law, M., Russo, A., Broda, K., (2015) The ILASP System for Learning Answer Set Programs, , https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/?ml1909/ILASP; Cunnington, D., Manotas, I., Law, M., De Mel, G., Calo, S., Bertino, E., Russo, A., A generative policy model for connected and autonomous vehicles (2019) 2019 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference, , Oct. due to appear; White, G., Ingham, J., Law, M., Russo, A., Using an asg based generative policy to model human rules (2019) 2019 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP), , Jun; Calo, S., Verma, D., Chakraborty, S., Bertino, E., Lupu, E., Cirincione, G., Self-generation of access control policies (2018) Proceedings of the 23Nd ACM on Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies, Ser.

Yet, challenges remain in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) models in real-world cases, such as dependence on extensive data and trust, explainability, traceability, and interactivity. These challenges are amplified in high-risk fields, including healthcare, cyber threats, crisis response, autonomous driving, and future manufacturing. On the other hand, symbolic computing with knowledge graphs has shown significant growth in specific tasks with reliable performance. This tutorial (a) discusses the novel paradigm of knowledge-infused deep learning to synthesize neural computing with symbolic computing (b) describes different forms of knowledge and infusion methods in deep learning, and (c) discusses application-specific evaluation methods to assure explainability and reasoning using benchmark datasets and knowledge-resources. The resulting paradigm of ""knowledge-infused learning"" combines knowledge from both domain expertise and physical models. A wide variety of techniques involving shallow, semi-deep, and deep infusion will be discussed along with the corresponding intuitions, limitations, use cases, and applications.

ATPL exploits Tensor Product Representations (TPR), a structured neural-symbolic model developed in cognitive science, to integrate deep learning with explicit natural language structures and rules. The key ideas of ATPL are: 1) unsupervised learning of role-unbinding vectors of words via the TPR-based deep neural network; 2) the use of attention modules to compute TPR; and 3) the integration of TPR with typical deep learning architectures including long short-term memory and feedforward neural networks. The novelty of our approach lies in its ability to extract the grammatical structure of a sentence by using role-unbinding vectors, which are obtained in an unsupervised manner. Our ATPL approach is applied to 1) image captioning, 2) part of speech (POS) tagging, and 3) constituency parsing of a natural language sentence. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in all these three natural language processing tasks. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Historical evidence of such attacks has shown that the vast majority of malicious attempts against both physical and virtual IT systems were based or been initiated using social engineering methods. By identifying the importance of tackling efficiently cybersecurity threats and using the recent developments in machine learning, case-based reasoning and cybersecurity we propose and demonstrate a two-stage approach that detects social engineering attacks and is based on natural language processing, case-based reasoning and deep learning. Our approach can be applied in offline texts or real time environments and can identify whether a human, chatbot or offline conversation is a potential social engineering attack or not. Initially, the conversation text is parsed and checked for grammatical errors using natural language processing techniques and case-based reasoning and then deep learning is used to identify and isolate possible attacks. Our proposed method is being evaluated using both real and semi-synthetic conversation points with high accuracy results. Comparison benchmarks are also presented for comparisons in both datasets. © Copyright 2019 for this paper by its authors.","Attack Detection; Case-based Reasoning; Cybersecurity; Deep Learning; Natural Language Processing; Social Engineering","Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Attack detection; Cyber security; Grammatical errors; High-accuracy; NAtural language processing; Real-time environment; Social engineering; Two stage approach; Case based reasoning","Sawa, Y., Bhakta, R., Harris, I.G., Hadnagy, C., Detection of social engineering attacks through natural language processing of conversations (2016) 2016 IEEE Tenth International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC), pp. 262-265. , IEEE 2016; Peng, T., Harris, I., Sawa, Y., Detecting phishing attacks using natural language processing and machine learning (2018) 2018 IEEE 12th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC), , IEEE, 2018; Mouton, F., Nottingham, A., Leenen, L., Venter, H.S., Finite state machine for the social engineering attack detection model: SEADM (2018) SAIEE Africa Research Journal, 109 (2), pp. 133-148. , (2018); Tsinganos, N., Sakellariou, G., Fouliras, P., Mavridis, I., Towards an automated recognition system for chat-based social engineering attacks in enterprise environments (2018) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, p. 53. , ACM 2018; Cialdini, R.B., The science of persuasion (2001) Scientific American, 284 (2), pp. 76-81; Manning, C., Surdeanu, M., Bauer, J., Finkel, J., Bethard, S., McClosky, D., The Stanford CoreNLP natural language processing toolkit (2014) Proceedings of 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations, pp. 55-60. , 2014; Hoeschele, M., Rogers, M., Detecting social engineering (2005) IFIP International Conference on Digital Forensics., , Springer, Boston, MA 2005; Hoeschele, M., (2006) CERIAS Tech Report 2006-15 DETECTING SOCIAL ENGINEERING., , (2006); Abid, J., Asif, K., Ghulam, Z., Nazir, M.K., Alam, S.M., Ashraf, R., MPMPA: A mitigation and prevention model for social engineering based phishing attacks on facebook (2018) 2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), pp. 5040-5048. , IEEE 2018; Bhakta, R., Harris, I.G., Semantic analysis of dialogs to detect social engineering attacks (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE 9th International Conference on Semantic Computing (IEEE ICSC 2015), , IEEE, 2015; Heartfield, R., Loukas, G., Detecting semantic social engineering attacks with the weakest link: Implementation and empirical evaluation of a human-as-a-security-sensor framework (2018) Computers & Security, 76, pp. 101-127. , (2018); Bezuidenhout, M., Mouton, F., Venter, H.S., Social engineering attack detection model: Seadm (2010) 2010 Information Security for South Africa, , IEEE, 2010; Mouton, F., Leenen, L., Venter, H.S., Social engineering attack detection model: Seadmv2 (2015) 2015 International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW), , IEEE; Nicholson, J., Coventry, L., Briggs, P., Can we fight social engineering attacks by social means?

Almost unconsciously, we provide our language utterances with temporal cues, like verb tenses, and we can hardly produce sentences without such cues. Extracting temporal cues from text, and constructing a global temporal view about the order of described events is a major challenge of automatic natural language understanding. Temporal reasoning, the process of combining different temporal cues into a coherent temporal view, plays a central role in temporal information extraction.

Understanding the reasoning behind certain fake items implies inferring a lot of details about the various actors involved. We believe that the solution to this problem should be a hybrid one, combining machine learning, semantics and natural language processing. We introduce a new semantic fake news detection method built around relational features like sentiment, entities or facts extracted directly from text. Our experiments show that by adding semantic features the accuracy of fake news classification improves significantly. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deep learning; NLP; Relation Extraction; Semantics","Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Semantics; Detection methods; NAtural language processing; Relation extraction; Relational features; Semantic features; Deep learning","Abadi, M., (2016) Tensorflow: A System for Large-Scale Machine Learning, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08695, CoRR abs/1605.08695; Aghakhani, H., Machiry, A., Nilizadeh, S., Kruegel, C., Vigna, G., (2018) Detecting Deceptive Reviews Using Generative Adversarial Networks, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10364, CoRR abs/1805.10364; Allcott, H., Gentzkow, M., Social media and fake news in the 2016 election (2017) J.

Proposed alternatives involve translating the question and the natural language text to a logical representation and then use logical reasoning. However, this alternative falters when the size of the text gets bigger. To address this we propose an approach that does logical reasoning over premises written in natural language text. The proposed method uses recent features of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to call external NLP modules (which may be based on ML) which perform simple textual entailment. To test our approach we develop a corpus based on the life cycle questions and showed that Our system achieves up to 18% performance gain when compared to standard MCQ solvers. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).",,"Life cycle; Logic programming; Natural language processing systems; Additional knowledge; Answer set programming; Logical reasoning; Logical representations; Natural language text; Question Answering; Question answering systems; Textual entailment; Artificial intelligence","Bos, J., Wide-coverage semantic analysis with boxer (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Semantics in Text Processing, , Association for Computational Linguistics; Bowman, S.

Various attempts have been made to reduce the complexities (language understanding, feature extraction, domain recognition, intent detection, semantic slot filling and language generation) of training text-based Chatbot. While Traditional machine learning models are usually unable to be truly generic, recent advances in deep learning allow end-to-end models to be trained with large dataset. We train an open domain Chatbot end-to-end by directly mapping input tags as sequences to generate optimized output sequence tags. Our model is trained on Google Tensorflow framework running GPUs with deep neural architecture of sequence-to-sequence and attention mechanism. The interaction of the chatbot with human performed common sense reasoning. It also achieved a competitive result when quantified based on Human Performance Evaluation. However, we suggest networked reinforcement learning to incrementally update the consistency drawbacks towards achieving a generic Chatbot. © 2019 ACM.","End-to-End; Natural Language Processing; Open Domain Chatbot; Seq2Seq","Character recognition; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Large dataset; Modeling languages; Program processors; Reinforcement learning; Semantics; Chatbot; Commonsense reasoning; Conversational systems; End to end; Language understanding; Machine learning models; NAtural language processing; Seq2Seq; Natural language processing systems","Radziwill, N., Benton, M., (2016) Evaluating Quality of Chatbots and Intelligent Conversational Agents; Wu, W., (2018) Towards Interpretable Chit-chat: Open Domain Dialogue Generation with Dialogue Acts, pp. 1-18; Turing, A.M., (1950) Computing Machinery and Intelligence; Serban, I.V., Sordoni, A., Bengio, Y., Courville, A., Pineau, J., (2014) Building End-to-End Dialogue Systems Using Generative Hierarchical Neural Network Models, pp. 3776-3783; Vinyals, O., Le, Q., (2015) A Neural Conversational Model, 37; Weizenbaum, J., Eliza-a computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine (1966) Commun.

It is considered as a challenging task with wide range of enterprise applications. Wide range of natural language understanding and reasoning tasks are found embedded within machine reading comprehension datasets. This requires effective models with robust relational reasoning capabilities to answer complex questions. Reasoning in natural language is a long-term machine-learning goal and is critically needed for building intelligent agents. However, most papers heavily depend on underlying language modeling and thus pay little to no attention on creating effective reasoning models. This paper proposes a modified transformer architecture that effectively combines soft and hard attention to create multi-perspective reasoning model capable of tackling wide range of reasoning tasks. An attention mechanism that highlights the relational significance of input signals is considered as well. The result from this study shows performance gain as compared to its counterpart the transformer network on bAbI dataset, a natural language reasoning tasks. © 2021 ACM.","machine reading comprehension;

Our model builds an object-based scene representation and translates sentences into executable, symbolic programs. To bridge the learning of two modules, we use a neuro-symbolic reasoning module that executes these programs on the latent scene representation. Analogical to human concept learning, the perception module learns visual concepts based on the language description of the object being referred to. Meanwhile, the learned visual concepts facilitate learning new words and parsing new sentences. We use curriculum learning to guide the searching over the large compositional space of images and language. Extensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our model on learning visual concepts, word representations, and semantic parsing of sentences. Further, our method allows easy generalization to new object attributes, compositions, language concepts, scenes and questions, and even new program domains. It also empowers applications including visual question answering and bidirectional image-text retrieval. © 7th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2019.

One such kind of task is VQA (Visual Question Answering) which is inherently divided into many layers of complexities. Some questions are simple having obvious answers while some are more complex which need logical reasoning, common sense and factual knowledge. Starting simple and gradually incorporating complexity, is always a good idea in scientific research and development. At first, datasets were simpler consisting of simple question-answer pairs with images depicting simpler concepts and relatively naive VQA models were trained on them. Slowly, with time, the VQA datasets got more complicated and tangled demanding more cognitive capabilities from VQA models. This evolution pushed the VQA models to be more efficient in matching human cognitive abilities, using reasoning based on common sense and factual knowledge. In this survey, we will first discuss some of the famous datasets in the domain of VQA and then we will discuss some of the crucial advancements in the VQA architectures and what is currently being done for integrating common sense and knowledge into these models. Moreover, reasoning is very crucial for truly intelligent systems but representations in deep learning models are inherently very fuzzy and vague. We need models that can transparently generate reasoning about their predictions like old school expert systems which used to work on symbolic knowledge, so the architectures based on the amalgam of deep learning techniques and Symbolic representations would also be a part of our discussion. We will also shed some light on the impact of transformers in the field of deep learning and how these transformer based models are quickly becoming state-of-the-art in almost every deep learning task. © 2021 IEEE.","Graph Convolutional Networks; Image Semantic Understanding; Natural Language Processing; Transformers; Visual Question Answering","Deep learning; Expert systems; Intelligent systems; Natural language processing systems; Cognitive capability; Human cognitive abilities; Learning techniques; Nlp (natural language processing); Question-answer pairs; Scientific researches; Symbolic representation; Visual interpretation; Learning systems","Khurram, I., Fraz, M.M., Shahzad, M., Detailed sentence generation architecture for image semantics description (2018) International Symposium on Visual Computing, pp. 423-432. , Springer; Khurram, I., Fraz, M., Shahzad, M., Rajpoot, N., Dense-captionnet: A sentence generation architecture for fine-grained description of image semantics (2020) Cognitive Computation, pp. 1-17; Mikolov, T., Chen, K., Corrado, G., Dean, J., Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space (2013) Iclr (Workshop Poster); Rizvi, S.K.J., Azad, M.A., Fraz, M.M., Spectrum of advancements and developments in multidisciplinary domains for generative adversarial networks (gans) (2021) Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering, pp. 1-19; Mogadala, A., Kalimuthu, M., Klakow, D., (2019) Trends in Integration of Vision and Language Research: A Survey of Tasks, Datasets, and Methods, , arXiv preprint; Srivastava, Y., Murali, V., Dubey, S.R., Mukherjee, S., (2019) Visual Question Answering Using Deep Learning: A Survey and Performance Analysis, , arXiv preprint; Marino, K., Chen, X., Parikh, D., Gupta, A., Rohrbach, M., (2020) Krisp: Integrating Implicit and Symbolic Knowledge for Open-Domain Knowledge-Based Vqa; Antol, S., Agrawal, A., Lu, J., Mitchell, M., Batra, D., Zitnick, C.L., Parikh, D., Vqa: Visual question answering (2015) Proceedings of the Ieee International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December; Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L., Microsoft coco: Common objects in context (2014) European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 740-755. , Springer; Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Li, F., Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations (2016) CoRR, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07332, vol. abs/1602.07332, [Online]; Johnson, J., Hariharan, B., Maaten Der, L.Van, Fei-Fei, L., Lawrence Zitnick, C., Girshick, R., Clevr: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning (2017) Proceedings of the Ieee Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2901-2910; Acharya, M., Kafle, K., Kanan, C., Tallyqa: Answering complex counting questions (2018) CoRR, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12440, vol. abs/1810.12440, [Online]; Marino, K., Rastegari, M., Farhadi, A., Mottaghi, R., Ok-vqa: A visual question answering benchmark requiring external knowledge (2019) Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); Hudson, D.A., Manning, C.D., Gqa: A new dataset for real-world visual reasoning and compositional question answering (2019) Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 6700-6709; Shah, S., Mishra, A., Yadati, N., Talukdar, P.P., Kvqa: Knowledge-aware visual question answering (2019) Proceedings of the Aaai Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 33 (1), pp. 8876-8884; Ahmed, S.B., Ali, S.F., Ahmad, J., Adnan, M., Fraz, M.M., On the frontiers of pose invariant face recognition: A review (2020) Artificial Intelligence Review, 53 (4), pp. 2571-2634; Auer, S., Bizer, C., Kobilarov, G., Lehmann, J., Cyganiak, R., Ives, Z., Dbpedia: A nucleus for a web of open data (2007) The Semantic Web, pp. 722-735. , Springer; Bhakthavatsalam, S., Richardson, K., Tandon, N., Clark, P., (2020) Do Dogs Have Whiskers?

Symbolic/logical-reasoning techniques have shown great success in interpreting structured data such as table extraction in webpages, custom text files, spreadsheets. The tables in PDF documents are often generated from such structured sources (text-based Word/LATEX documents, spreadsheets, webpages) but end up being unstructured. We thus explore novel combinations of deep learning and symbolic reasoning techniques to build an effective solution for PDF table extraction. We evaluate effectiveness without granting partial credit for matching part of a table (which may cause silent errors in downstream data processing).

AI offers substantial capabilities to solve new problems and optimise existing solutions specialising on specific problems and learning from different domains. AI solutions can be either explainable or black box ones with the latter being urged to improve since they cannot trust. Case-based Reasoning (CBR) is an explainable AI approach where solutions are provided along with relevant explanations in terms of why a solution was selected. However, CBR, like most other explainable approaches, has several limitations in terms of scalability, large data volumes, domain complexity, that reduce its ability to scale any CBR system in industrial applications. In this paper, we provide a heterogeneous CBR framework - DeepKAF where we combine CBR paradigm with Deep Learning architectures to solve complicated Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems (eg. mixed language and grammatically incorrect text).DeepKAF is built based on continuous research in the area of Deep Learning and CBR. DeepKAF has been implemented and used across different domains, test use cases and research models as an ensemble deep learning and CBR Architecture. © 2020 IEEE.","Case-based Reasoning; Deep Learning; Natural Language Processing","Case based reasoning; Intelligent systems; Natural language processing systems; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Different domains; Large data volumes; Learning approach; Learning architectures; NAtural language processing; Research models; Specific problems; Deep learning","Aamodt, A., Plaza, E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches (1994) AI Communications, 1 (7). , March; Goel, A.K., Diaz-Agudo, B., What's hot in case-based reasoning Proceedings of the Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-17); Amin, K., Lancaster, G., Kapetanakis, S., Althoff, K.D., Dengel, A., Petridis, M., Case-based reasoning in natural language processing: Word2vec vs fasttext 23rd UK Symposium on Case-Based Reasoning, , Cambridge; Amin, K., Lancaster, G., Kapetanakis, S., Althoff, K.D., Dengel, A., Petridis, M., Advanced similarity measures using wordembeddings and siamese networks in cbr. in. intelligent systems and applications (2019) IntelliSys 2019.

Despite deep learning models have shown strong performance on various cross-sentence inference benchmarks, recent work has shown that they are leveraging spurious statistical cues rather than capturing deeper implied relations between pairs of sentences. In this paper, we show that the state-of-the-art language encoding models are especially bad at modeling directional relations between sentences by proposing a new evaluation task: Cause-and-Effect relation prediction task. Back by our curated Causeand-Effect Relation dataset (CER), we also demonstrate that a mutual attention mechanism can guide the model to focus on capturing directional relations between sentences when added to existing transformer-based models. Experiment results show that the proposed approach improves the performance on downstream applications, such as the abductive reasoning task. © 2020 The Twenty-Fifth AAAI/SIGAI Doctoral Consortium (AAAI-20).

Scientific research on PIL reveals the need to create a bridge between European and national laws. In this context, legal experts have to access heterogeneous sources, being able to recall all the norms and to combine them using case-laws and following the principles of interpretation theory. This clearly poses a daunting challenge to humans, whenever Regulations change frequently or are big-enough in size. Automated reasoning over legal texts is not a trivial task, because legal language is very specific and in many ways different from a commonly used natural language. When applying state-of-the-art language models to legalese understanding, one of the challenges is always to figure how to optimally use the available amount of data. This makes hard to apply state-of-the-art sub-symbolic question answering algorithms on legislative texts, especially the PIL ones, because of data scarcity. In this paper we try to expand previous works on legal question answering, publishing a larger and more curated dataset for the evaluation of automated question answering on PIL. © 2021 ACM.","knowledge graph extraction; legal question answering; private international law","Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing systems; Automated reasoning; Heterogeneous sources; Legal questions; Natural languages; Private international law; Question Answering; Scientific researches; State of the art; Laws and legislation","Ashley, K.D., (2017) Artificial Intelligence and Legal Analytics: New Tools for Law Practice in the Digital Age, , Cambridge University Press; Bench-Capon, T., Araszkiewicz, M., Ashley, K., Atkinson, K., Bex, F., Borges, F., Bourcier, D., Francesconi, E., A history of AI and law in 50 papers: 25 years of the international conference on ai and law (2012) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 20 (3), pp. 215-319. , 2012; Ii, M.J.B., Katz, D.M., Detterman, E.M., (2018) Lex NLP: Natural Language Processing and Information Extraction for Legal and Regulatory Texts, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.03688 (2018); Casanovas, P., Palmirani, M., Peroni, S., Van Engers, T., Vitali, F., Semantic web for the legal domain: The next step (2016) Semantic Web, 7 (3), pp. 213-227. , 2016; Chalkidis, I., Kampas, D., Deep learning in law: Early adaptation and legal word embeddings trained on large corpora (2019) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 27 (2), pp. 171-198. , 2019; Conrad, J.G., Zeleznikow, J., The significance of evaluation in AI and law: A case study re-examining ICAIL proceedings (2013) Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 186-191; Do, P.-K., Nguyen, H.-T., Tran, C.-X., Nguyen, M.-T., Nguyen, M.-L., (2017) Legal Question Answering Using Ranking SVM and Deep Convolutional Neural Network, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.05320 2017; Fernández-Barrera, M., Sartor, G., The legal theory perspective: Doctrinal conceptual systems vs. Computational ontologies (2011) Approaches to Legal Ontologies, pp. 15-47. , Springer; Holzenberger, N., Blair-Stanek, A., Van Durme, B., (2020) A Dataset for Statutory Reasoning in Tax Law Entailment and Question Answering, , arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.05257 (2020); Kim, M.-Y., Xu, Y., Goebel, R., A convolutional neural network in legal question answering (2015) JURISIN Workshop; Kratochwil, F.V., (1991) Rules, Norms, and Decisions: On the Conditions of Practical and Legal Reasoning in International Relations and Domestic Affairs, (2). , Cambridge University Press; Ravichander, A., Black, A.W., Wilson, S., Norton, T., Sadeh, N., (2019) Question Answering for Privacy Policies: Combining Computational and Legal Perspectives, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.00841 (2019); Sovrano, F., Palmirani, M., Vitali, F., Legal knowledge extraction for knowledge graph based question-answering (2020) Legal Knowledge and Information Systems: JURIX 2020.

While different methods have been developed to represent the environment information and language actions, existing RL agents are not empowered with any reasoning capabilities to deal with textual games. In this work, we aim to conduct explicit reasoning with knowledge graphs for decision making, so that the actions of an agent are generated and supported by an interpretable inference procedure. We propose a stacked hierarchical attention mechanism to construct an explicit representation of the reasoning process by exploiting the structure of the knowledge graph.

At the same time, deep learning technologies have also grown significantly. Thus, it is essential to investigate the hardware acceleration and deployment of deep learning algorithms on edge devices. Two types of deep neural networks RNN and CNN are widely used for NLP (Natural Language Processing). Recent exploration of CNN based methods for NLP has proven that they are fast and effective. In this paper, we discuss multi-class text classification using 1D Temporal convolutional neural networks. We have explored the acceleration and deployment of our model on the Xilinx PYNQ (Python Productivity for ZYNQ) FPGA board. In this paper, we explored the features of character-level text classification which proves to be a perfect fit for edge applications owing to adaptivity to misspelled, infrequent words or informal text, lightweight models, and low latency. We have accelerated our text classification model using coarse pruning and quantization. The deployment exploits the strong relationship of a sequential processor with a PL (programmable logic) as an accelerator, to implement power efficient and low latency inference machine learning architecture. The model is evaluated on a dataset of reviews for several brands. A method of evaluation robustness of text classifications model, for informal language and misspellings, is also proposed. Compared to GPU, after proposed hardware acceleration a 50% drop in latency and a 1500% decrease in power has been observed on an FPGA. © 2021 IEEE.","CNN; Embedded; FPGA; Hardware Acceleration; NLP; Text Classification; ZYNQ","Classification (of information); Computation theory; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Recurrent neural networks; Hardware acceleration; Internet of thing (IOT); Learning technology; Nlp (natural language processing); Programmable logic; Sequential processors; Text classification; Text classification models; Text processing","Schultz, J., How much data is created on the internet each day?

Existing deep learning approaches for semantic parsing have shown promise on a variety of benchmark data sets, particularly on textto- SQL parsing. However, most text-to-SQL parsers do not generalize to unseen data sets in different domains. In this paper, we propose a new cross-domain learning scheme to perform text-to-SQL translation and demonstrate its use on Spider, a large-scale cross-domain text-to-SQL data set. We improve upon a state-of-the-art Spider model, SyntaxSQLNet, by constructing a graph of column names for all databases and using graph neural networks to compute their embeddings. The resulting embeddings offer better cross-domain representations and SQL queries, as evidenced by substantial improvement on the Spider data set compared to SyntaxSQLNet. © 2019 EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 - Graph-Based Methods for Natural Language Processing - Proceedings of the 13th Workshop.

However, language reasoning and understanding remain difficult tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this work, we consider this problem and propose a novel Knowledge-Infused Document Embedding Representation (KIDER) for text categorization. We use knowledge patterns to generate high quality document representation. These patterns preserve categorical-distinctive semantic information, provide interpretability, and achieve superior performances at the same time. Experiments show that the KIDER model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two important NLP tasks, i.e., emotion analysis and news topic detection, by 7% and 20%. In addition, we also demonstrate the potential of highlighting important information for each category and news using these patterns. These results show the value of knowledge-infused patterns in terms of interpretability and performance enhancement. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Knowledge representation; Natural Language Processing; Text categorization","Deep learning; Embeddings; Intelligent systems; Semantics; Text processing; Document Representation; Knowledge patterns; NAtural language processing; News topic detections; Performance enhancements; Semantic information; State-of-the-art methods; Text categorization; Natural language processing systems","Aggarwal, C.C., Zhai, C., (2012) Mining Text Data, , Springer Science & Business Media, Heidelberg; Wu, H., Salton, G., A comparison of search term weighting: term relevance vs. inverse document frequency (1981) ACM SIGIR Forum, 16, pp. 30-39. , ACM; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G.S., Dean, J., Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality (2013) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3111-3119; LeCun, Y., Backpropagation applied to handwritten zip code recognition (1989) Neural Comput, 1 (4), pp. 541-551; Hochreiter, S., Schmidhuber, J., Long short-term memory (1997) Neural Comput, 9 (8), pp. 1735-1780; Devlin, J., Chang, M.W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., (2018) BERT: pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04805; Lee, J.Y., Dernoncourt, F., (2016) Sequential short-text classification with recurrent and convolutional neural networks, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.03827; Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., (2014) Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.0473; Alexander, J.A., (1994) Template-based procedures for neural network interpretation, , Ph.D. thesis, University of Colorado; Seidenberg, M., (2017) Language at the Speed of Sight How We Read, Why So Many Can’t, and What Can Be Done About It, , 1st edn.

An essential component of such a platform is the recommender systems that suggest the constituent user base, related tracks, albums and artists. In order to sustain such a recommender system, labeling data, to indicate which genre it belongs to is essential. Most recent academic publications that deal with music genre classification focus on the use of deep neural networks developed and applied within the music genre classification domain. This paper attempts to use some of the highly sophisticated techniques, such as Hierarchical Attention Networks that exist within the text classification domain in order to classify tracks of different genres. In order to do this, the music is first separated into different tracks (drums, vocals, bass and accompaniment) and converted into symbolic text data. Due to the sophistication of the distributed machine learning system present in this paper, it is capable of classifying contemporary genres with impressive accuracy, when comparing the results with that of competing classifiers. It is also argued that through the use text classification, the expert knowledge which musicians and people involved with musicological techniques, can be attracted to improving recommender systems within the music information retrieval research domain. © 2020 IEEE.","deep neural networks; distributed machine learning; hierarchical attention networks; mu- sic genre classification; music information retrieval; Online streaming; recommender systems","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Hierarchical systems; Information management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Online systems; Search engines; Text processing; Academic publications; Distributed machine learning; Expert knowledge; Genre classification; Music genre classification; Music information retrieval; NAtural language processing; Text classification; Recommender systems","Zheng, E., Moh, M., Moh, T.-S., Music genre classification: A ngram based musicological approach (2017) 2017 IEEE 7th International Advance Computing Conference (IACC), pp. 671-677. , IEEE; Sridharan, A., Moh, M., Moh, T.-S., Similarity estimation for classical indian music (2018) 2018 17th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), pp. 814-819. , IEEE; Li, M., Sleep, R., Melody classification using a similarity metric based on kolmogorov complexity (2004) Sound and Music Computing, 2012; Kotsifakos, A., Kotsifakos, E.E., Papapetrou, P., Athitsos, V., Genre classification of symbolic music with smbgt (2013) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments, p. 44. , ACM; McKay, C., Fujinaga, I., Automatic genre classification using large high-level musical feature sets (2004) ISMIR 2004, pp. 525-530; Choi, K., Fazekas, G., Sandler, M., Cho, K., Convolutional recurrent neural networks for music classification (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 2392-2396. , IEEE; Dai, J., Liu, W., Ni, C., Dong, L., Yang, H., Multilingual deep neural network for music genre classification (2015) Sixteenth Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association; Jeong, I.-Y., Lee, K., Learning temporal features using a deep neural network and its application to music genre classification (2016) Ismir, pp. 434-440; Yang, Z., Yang, D., Dyer, C., He, X., Smola, A., Hovy, E., Hierarchical attention networks for document classification (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Associ-Ation for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pp. 1480-1489; Southall, C., Stables, R., Hockman, J., Automatic drum transcription using bi-directional recurrent neural networks (2016) ISMIR, pp. 591-597; Chandna, P., Miron, M., Janer, J., Gómez, E., Monoaural audio source separation using deep convolutional neural networks (2017) Inter-National Conference on Latent Variable Analysis and Signal Separation, pp. 258-266. , Springer; bzameknic, Musical Instrument Classification.

To do this, the choice of an ideal representation is guided by the domain characteristics and the complexity of its cases. Recently, the explosion of deep learning techniques and other forms of vectorised representations, has provided a new source for case insights. Richer text features can be extracted and used for each case if required. In this paper, we build on recent work in this area and generate richer case representation by automatically acquiring domain knowledge from unstructured sentences. We describe how the Deep Knowledge Acquisition Framework obtains its representation vectors from stemmed words and improving these vectors iteratively, suggesting high quality outputs and relevance to domain experts based on either explicit queries or their past intentions. We evaluate these ideas using two, not related, datasets from the automotive and legal domains respectively. The results show the benefits of combining Autoencoders and Siamese Networks in CBR while achieving better textual data dimensionality reduction, data de-noising and similarity measures. © 2019 IEEE.","Autoencoders; Case-based Reasoning; Deep Learning; Multi-lingual Text Analysis; Natural Language Processing; Siamese Networks; Textual CBR","Deep learning; Dimensionality reduction; Iterative methods; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Autoencoders; Case representation; Data de-noising; Domain knowledge; Learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Similarity measure; Text analysis; Case based reasoning","Aamodt, A., Plaza, E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches (1994) AI Communications, 1 (7). , March; Jalali, V., Leake, D., CBR meets big data: A case study of large-scale adaptation rule generation (2015) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, pp. 181-196; Daengdej, J., Lukose, D., Tsui, E., Beinat, P., Prophet, L., Dynamically creating indices for two million cases: A real world problem (1996) Advances in Case-Based Reasoning, p. 105119. , Berlin, Springer; Beaver, I., Dumoulin, J., Applying mapreduce to learning user preferences in near realtime (2014) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, ICCBR 2014, p. 1528. , Berlin, Springer; Plaza, E., Semantics and experience in the future web (2008) Proceedings of the Ninth European Conference on Case-Based Reasoning, p. 4458. , Springer; Ontanon, S., Lee, Y.C., Snodgrass, S., Bonfiglio, D., Winston, F., Mc-Donald, C., Gonzalez, A., Case-based prediction of teen driver behavior and skill (2014) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, ICCBR 2014, p. 375389. , Berlin, Springer; Cordier, A., Lefevre, M., Champin, P.A., Georgeon, O., Mille, A., Tracebased reasoning modeling interaction traces for reasoning on experiences (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Florida AI Research Symposium, p. 363368. , AAAI Press; Amin, K., Kapetanakis, S., Althoff, K.D., Dengel, A., Petridis, M., Answering with cases: A cbr approach to deep learning (2018) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development.

KGs can be created in several ways: manually with forms or automatically with Information Extraction (IE), a natural language processing task for extracting knowledge from text. Relation Extraction is the part of IE that focuses on identifying relations between named entities in texts, which amounts to find new edges in a KG. Most recent approaches rely on deep learning, achieving state-of-the-art performances. However, those performances are still too low to fully automatize the construction of reliable KGs, and human interaction remains necessary. This is made difficult by the statistical nature of deep learning methods that makes their predictions hardly interpretable. In this paper, we present a new symbolic and interpretable approach for Relation Extraction in texts. It is based on a modeling of the lexical and syntactic structure of text as a knowledge graph, and it exploits Concepts of Neighbours, a method based on Graph-FCA for computing similarities in knowledge graphs. An evaluation has been performed on a subset of TACRED (a relation extraction benchmark), showing promising results. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Deep learning; Information analysis; Knowledge representation; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Syntactics; Human interactions; Knowledge graphs; Learning methods; Named entities; NAtural language processing; Relation extraction; State-of-the-art performance; Syntactic structure; Formal concept analysis","Ferré, S., Cellier, P., Graph-, F.C.A., An extension of formal concept analysis to knowledge graphs (2019) Discrete Appl.

However, the correct specification and interpretation of temporal logic formulas require a strong mathematical background and can hardly be done by domain experts, who, instead, tend to rely on a natural language description of the intended system behaviour. In such situations, a system that is able to automatically translate English sentences into LTL formulas, and vice versa, would be of great help. While the task of rendering an LTL formula into a more readable English sentence may be carried out in a relatively easy way by properly parsing the formula, the converse is still an open problem, due to the inherent difficulty of interpreting free, natural language texts. Although several partial solutions have been proposed in the past, the literature still lacks a critical assessment of the work done. We address such a shortcoming, presenting the current state of the art for what concerns the English-to-LTL translation problem, and outlining some possible research directions. © Michael H.

The concept uses the corpus of two languages and then translates the input text to desired target text by proper matching. The different languages have different language structure of the subject-object-verb (SOV) alignment. The matching is then arranged to give proper meaning in target text language and to form proper structure. This paper, describes the Example Based Machine Translation using Natural Language Processing demo. The proposed EBMT framework can be used for automatic translation of text by reusing the examples of previous translations through the use of Fuzzy which is proposed work. This framework comprises of three phases, matching, alignment and recombination.

Even with Natural Language Processing approach, it limits with the absence of specific Named Entity recognizer to extract related entities of malware from unstructured data like text. It is essential to automate the process of extracting information such as Ransomware entity from text and the information extracted could be used as knowledge reasoning like profiling the behaviour of Ransomware using the information available on the Internet. Although the text itself is unstructured, informal text like Internet forum has its problems and challenges to perform the analysis and extraction process. Thus, the performance of machine learning in carrying out the classification of entities from this type of text depending on the complexity of the model.

In artificial intelligence, we witness a resurgence of neural networks against the symbolic school which is manifested by many breakthroughs in gaming, image recognition and natural language processing under the umbrella term of deep learning. Researchers are evaluating deep learning algorithms for static and behavioral malware analysis. In this paper, we benchmark deep learning architectures composed of recurrent and convolutional neural networks. We report results on different techniques such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1DCNN). We develop an automatic feature extraction component and a hybrid CNN/RNN classification model. We validate our model using the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015).

Current DL methods should provide contextual reasoning, explainable results, and repeatable understanding that require evaluation methods. This paper discusses DL techniques using multimodal (or multisource) information that extend measures of performance (MOP). Examples of joint multi-modal learning include imagery and text, video and radar, and other common sensor types. Issues with joint multimodal learning challenge many current methods and care is needed to apply machine learning methods. Results from Deep Multimodal Image Fusion (DMIF) using Electro-optical and infrared data demonstrate performance modeling based on distance to better understand DL robustness and quality to provide situation awareness. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

A number of natural language processing (NLP) processes, viz. archival, retrieval, query response, information summarization, etc., highly rely on automatic classification of text documents. This has induced researchers to apply machine learning logic to automatically categorize documents based on languages and within documents belonging to the same language to devise methods to segregate them according to its contents. More than at present, 70% of the total text classification process involves ‘Preprocessing of text’, alone [1]. This indicates its importance of preprocessing and the efficiency based on text classification logic is solely dependent on an efficient preprocessing step.

Since the introduction of workable DL, numerous success stories have been widely reported: board games, autonomous driving vehicles, natural language translation, voice recognition, etc. However, for machines to exhibit a high degree of intelligence, they need more than the ability to learn. Indeed, heavy reliance on ML has resulted in widely publicized mishaps that negatively affect people in unexpected ways. For healthcare and other mission-critical applications, intelligent machines need to perform dependably to earn and maintain the trust of human users. To this end, it is necessary to take a holistic view toward AI, one that encompasses multiple facets of what constitutes intelligence. Specifically, this paper previews what thinking machines would be capable of by taking into consideration a machine's ability to abstract and reason, in addition to its ability to learn. © 2020 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; knowledge representation; machine intelligence; machine learning; machine thinking; reasoning system; semantic computing; telehealth","Health care; Medical computing; Turing machines; Autonomous driving; Board games; Holistic view; Human users; Intelligent machine; Mission critical applications; Natural languages; Telehealth; Deep learning","Hopfield, J.J., Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities (1982) Proc.

Some of the white-box techniques include: the use of constraint solvers for the automatic generation of test inputs at the white box level; the use of control flow graphs generated from code; and the use of path generation and symbolic execution to generate test inputs and test for path feasibility. Techniques such as boundary value analysis (BVA) may also be used for generating stronger test suites. However, for black box testing we rely on specifications or implicit requirements and spend considerable time and effort designing and executing test cases. This paper presents an approach that leverages natural language processing and machine learning techniques to capture black box system behavior in the form of constraints. Constraint solvers are then used to generate test cases using BVA and equivalence class partitioning. We also conduct a proof of concept that applies this approach to a simplified task management application and an enterprise job recruiting application. © 2019 IEEE.","Black box testing; Constraint solvers; Form crawling; GUI Testing; Machine learning; Natural language processing","Automatic programming; Equivalence classes; Flow graphs; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logic programming; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Software reliability; Automatic Generation; Boundary value analysis; Constraint solvers; Control flow graphs; GUI testing; Machine learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Natural language systems; Black-box testing","Aamodt, A., Plaza, E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches (1994) AI Communications, 7 (1), pp. 39-59; Adamo, D., Alt, P., Briggs, K., Celli, N., Clarke, P.J., Daye, P., King, T.M., Santiago, D., (2019) Agent Source Code; Anand, S., Burke, E.K., Chen, T.Y., Clark, J., Cohen, M.B., Grieskamp, W., Harman, M., Bertolino, A., An orchestrated survey of methodologies for automated software test case generation (2013) Journal of Systems and Software, 86 (8), pp. 1978-2001; Arbon, J., AI for software testing (2017) Pacific NW Software Quality Conference.

This tool uses an action language ALM to perform inferences on complex interactions of events described in narratives. The methodology used to implement the TEXT2ALM system was originally outlined by Lierler, Inclezan, and Gelfond [13] via a manual process of converting a narrative to an ALM model. It relies on a conglomeration of resources and techniques from two distinct fields of artificial intelligence, namely, natural language processing and knowledge representation and reasoning. The effectiveness of system TEXT2ALM is measured by its ability to correctly answer questions from the bAbI tasks published by Facebook Research in 2015. This tool matched or exceeded the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning methods in six of the seven tested tasks. We also illustrate that the TEXT2ALM approach generalizes to a broader spectrum of narratives. © 2019 Open Publishing Association.

In this paper we focus on Facebook posts paired with “reactions” of multiple users, and we investigate their relationships with classes of emotions that are typically considered in the task of emotion detection. We are inspired by the idea of introducing a connection between reactions and emotions by means of First-Order Logic formulas, and we propose an end-to-end neural model that is able to jointly learn to detect emotions and predict Facebook reactions in a multi-task environment, where the logic formulas are converted into polynomial constraints. Our model is trained using a large collection of unsupervised texts together with data labeled with emotion classes and Facebook posts that include reactions. An extended experimental analysis that leverages a large collection of Facebook posts shows that the tasks of emotion classification and reaction prediction can both benefit from their interaction. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Emotion detection from text; Facebook reactions; Learning from Constraints","Forecasting; Formal logic; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Emotion classification; Emotion detection; Experimental analysis; Facebook; Learning from constraints; NAtural language processing; Reaction prediction; Social media datum; Social networking (online)","Agrawal, A., An, A., Unsupervised emotion detection from text using semantic and syntactic relations (2012) Proceedings of the International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology, Pp. 346–353.

Social networking is an invaluable medium for individuals to express their thoughts and views about any subject or topic, contributing to massive quantities of unstructured knowledge. These emotions can be processed and examined to analyze and obtain insights. Therefore, several machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods were used to examine these opinions. Because of the shifts in the sequential order, stream lengths, and complex logic, the exact sentiments in the consumer feedback are still difficult. Recently, deep learning methods have been used to attain improved results. The most common forms of deep learning method used are the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Long short-term memory (LSTM), particularly with attentive layers, pays greater focus to the sentiment impact. LSTM has an advantage over alternative RNNs and other deep learning approaches because of relative insensitivity to gap length. Deep learning approaches have better accuracy over existing state-of-the-art approaches because of their ability to handle extensive realtime data and the power of feature extraction, but there is still room for improvement. This paper has used Long Short-Term Model (LSTM) model to predict the customer review's opinion, attaining an accuracy of 93.66%. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the deep LSTM model with existing has been presented. © 2021 IEEE.","Deep Learning; LSTM; Machine Learning; Sentiment Analysis","Behavioral research; Convolutional neural networks; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Sentiment analysis; Comparative analysis; Learning approach; Learning methods; Massive quantities; NAtural language processing; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Sequential ordering; State-of-the-art approach; Deep learning","Bose, R., Dey, R.K., Roy, S., Sarddar, D., Analyzing political sentiment using twitter data (2019) Information and Communication Technology for Intelligent Systems, pp. 427-436. , Springer; Mudinas, A., Zhang, D., Levene, M., (2019) Market Trend Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis: Lessons Learned and Paths Forward; Barry, J., Sentiment analysis of online reviews using bag-of-words and lstm approaches (2017) Aics, pp. 272-274; Habimana, O., Li, Y., Li, R., Gu, X., Yu, G., Sentiment analysis using deep learning approaches: An overview (2020) Sci.

Enhancing the prior/posterior representation is addressed [53, 62]. We present how these models are connected and why they work for a variety of applications on symbolic and complex patterns in natural language. The variational inference and sampling method are formulated to tackle the optimization for complicated models [54]. The word and sentence embeddings, clustering and co-clustering are merged with linguistic and semantic constraints. A series of case studies, tasks and applications are presented to tackle different issues in deep Bayesian mining, searching, learning and understanding. At last, we will point out a number of directions and outlooks for future studies. This tutorial serves the objectives to introduce novices to major topics within deep Bayesian learning, motivate and explain a topic of emerging importance for data mining and natural language understanding, and present a novel synthesis combining distinct lines of machine learning work. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Bayesian learning; Data mining; Deep learning; Information retrieval; Natural language processing","Bayesian networks; Character recognition; Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Data mining; Deep learning; Distribution functions; Image segmentation; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Recommender systems; Recurrent neural networks; Semantics; Speech recognition; Speech transmission; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Text mining; Websites; Bayesian learning; Hierarchical Dirichlet process; Learning and understanding; NAtural language processing; Natural language understanding; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Sentiment classification; Stochastic neural network; Learning systems","Aksan, E., Hilliges, O., STCN: Stochastic temporal convolutional networks (2019) Proc.

In this paper, we have discussed how we can reduce the training time for deep learning models if we have already trained a model for a similar dataset. The basic logic here is that for similar dataset the features stored in the deep neural net are similar and the only difference comes for the classification layers of deep neural so instead of training the whole net we just train the last layers for classifying the data and use the trained model weights on the rest of the layers; this method saves a lot of time. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.","Deep learning; Machine learning; Natural language; Transfer learning model","Classification (of information); Computation theory; Deep neural networks; Intelligent computing; Neural networks; Transfer learning; Basic logic; Learning models; Model weights; Training time; Deep learning","Lu, J., Behbood, V., Hao, P., Zuo, H., Xue, S., Zhang, G., Transfer learning using computational intelligence: a survey (2015) Knowl.-Based Syst, 80, pp. 14-23; Tan, C., Sun, F., Kong, T., Zhang, W., Yang, C., Liu, C., A survey on deep transfer learning (2018) International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks, pp. 270-279. , Springer, Cham; Sandeep, K.M., Prabhu, J., Recent development in big data analytics: research perspective (2018) Applications of Security, Mobile, Analytic, and Cloud (SMAC) Technologies for Effective Information Processing and Management.

Traditionally, “deep learning” is taken to be a learning process where the inference or optimization is based on the real-valued deterministic model. The “semantic structure” in words, sentences, entities, actions and documents drawn from a large vocabulary may not be well expressed or correctly optimized in mathematical logic or computer programs. The “distribution function” in discrete or continuous latent variable model for natural language may not be properly decomposed or estimated. This tutorial addresses the fundamentals of statistical models and neural networks, and focus on a series of advanced Bayesian models and deep models including hierarchical Dirichlet process, Chinese restaurant process, hierarchical Pitman-Yor process, Indian buffet process, recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory, sequence-to-sequence model, variational auto-encoder (VAE), generative adversarial network (GAN), attention mechanism, memory-augmented neural network, skip neural network, stochastic neural network, predictive state neural network, policy neural network. We present how these models are connected and why they work for a variety of applications on symbolic and complex patterns in natural language. The variational inference and sampling method are formulated to tackle the optimization for complicated models. The word and sentence embeddings, clustering and co-clustering are merged with linguistic and semantic constraints. A series of case studies are presented to tackle different issues in deep Bayesian mining, learning and understanding. At last, we will point out a number of directions and outlooks for future studies. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Bayesian learning; Deep learning; Natural language processing","Bayesian networks; Character recognition; Classification (of information); Data mining; Distribution functions; Image segmentation; Information retrieval systems; Natural language processing systems; Recurrent neural networks; Semantics; Speech recognition; Speech transmission; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Text processing; Bayesian learning; Hierarchical Dirichlet process; Latent variable modeling; Learning and understanding; NAtural language processing; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Sentiment classification; Stochastic neural network; Deep learning","Chien, J.-T., Hierarchical Pitman-yor-Dirichlet language model (2015) IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 23 (8), pp. 1259-1272. , 2015; Chien, J.-T., Laplace group sensing for acoustic models (2015) IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 23 (5), pp. 909-922. , 2015; Chien, J.-T., Hierarchical theme and topic modeling (2016) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 27 (3), pp. 565-578. , 2016; Chien, J.-T., Bayesian nonparametric learning for hierarchical and sparse topics (2018) IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 26 (2), pp. 422-435. , 2018; Chien, J.-T., Chang, Y.-L., Bayesian sparse topic model (2014) Journal of Signal Processing Systems, 74 (3), pp. 375-389. , 2014; Chien, J.-T., Chueh, C.-H., Dirichlet class language models for speech recognition (2011) IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 19 (3), pp. 482-495. , 2011; Chien, J.-T., Chueh, C.-H., Topic-based hierarchical segmentation (2012) IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 20 (1), pp. 55-66. , 2012; Chien, J.-T., Ku, Y.-C., Bayesian recurrent neural network for language modeling (2016) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 27 (2), pp. 361-374. , 2016; Chien, J.-T., Kuo, K.-T., Variational recurrent neural networks for speech separation (2017) Proc.

The intermingling of techniques in areas such as natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning, data mining, and knowledge representation provide a lot of possibilities for development of ontology learning approaches. A rise in focus on the ability to cope with the scale of Web data required for ontology learning forces the potential growth of cross-language research, emphasizing the automatic or semi-automatic generation of the tools dedicated to text mining and information extraction. This paper presents the integration of ontology learning tools from text in the knowledge repository to incorporate the applied techniques and outputs of an ontology learning algorithm into the one complex multifunctional solution. The proposed knowledge repository covers various applicability of existing techniques of learning ontologies from text, and offers competency question-based reasoning mechanism for individuals to specify their profiles of ontology learning tools. The validation stage is also provided in the form of applied reasoning. © 2019 The Author(s).

Concurrently, advances in artificial intelligence have made the coordination of many such agents possible. However, there is little work considering both the low-level reasoning that allows agents to interpret their environment, such as deep learning techniques, and the high-level reasoning that coordinates such agents.

In response to that challenge the article proposes a computationally adequate method for design of a neural network capable of performing an important group of symbolic operations on a sub-symbolic level without initial learning: extraction of elements of a given structure, conditional branching and construction of a new structure. The neural network primitive infers on distributed representations of symbolic structures and represents a proof of concept for the viability of implementation of symbolic rules in a neural pipeline for various tasks like language analysis or aggregation of linguistic assessments during the decision making process. The proposed method was practically implemented and evaluated within the Keras framework. The network designed was tested for a particular case of transforming active-passive sentences represented in parsed grammatical structures. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Artificial neural networks; Linguistic decision making; Natural language processing; Tensor product representations","Decision making; Design; Decision making process; Distributed representation; Grammatical structure; Language analysis; Linguistic assessment; Neural network designs; Structural transformation; Symbolic operations; Neural networks","Abadi, M., (2015) TensorFlow: large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems, , http://tensorflow.org/.Softwareavailablefromtensorflow.org; Besold, T.R., (2017) Neural-symbolic learning and reasoning: a survey and interpretation, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03902; Besold, T.R., Kühnberger, K.U., Towards integrated neural-symbolic systems for human-level AI: two research programs helping to bridge the gaps (2015) Biol.

The content of a medical guideline is based on a systematic review of clinical evidence with instructions and recommendations that clinicians can refer to. Most of the guidelines are available in an unstructured text format. Hence, clinicians must take a considerable time to search and find relevant recommendations in their semantic context. Using Machine Learning algorithms, automatic information extraction from medical guidelines has recently become possible. We present a novel system for information extraction and a fuzzy rule database developed for clinical guidelines. The proposed system, dubbed NLP-FUZZY, combines capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Fuzzy Logic approaches. First, the NLP-FUZZY performs a semantic extraction of medical guidelines using a bi-directional Long short-term memory (LSTM). Subsequently, using the extracted semantic, it creates fuzzy rules, which are able to recognize new cases in a learning domain while predicting and extract the grade of recommendation. In order to test the NLP-FUZZY system, we compared its performance with state-of-the-art NLP approaches for clinical information extraction. © 42nd International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics, MIPRO 2019 - Proceedings.

In this talk, I present an approach to tackle such phenomena by means of syntactic information. Our approach combines machine learning and symbolic processing: the former is used to obtain dependency trees for input sentences, and the latter to obtain the sentiment polarity for each sentence using handwritten rules that traverse the tree. Thanks to universal guidelines for syntactic annotation, our approach is applicable to multiple languages without rewriting the rules. Additionally, very accurate parsing is not needed for our approach to be helpful: fast and simple parsers will do, even if they lag behind state-of-the-art accuracy.

Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) using serverless computing paradigm provides high performance and low cost solutions for deploying such applications on cloud while minimizing the operational logic. Using FaaS for efficient deployment of complex applications, such as natural language processing (NLP) and image processing, containing large deep learning models will be an advantage. However, constrained resources and stateless nature of FaaS offers numerous challenges while deploying such applications. In this work, we discuss the methodological suggestions and their implementation for deploying pre-trained large size machine learning and deep learning models on FaaS. We also evaluate the performance and deployment cost of an enterprise application, consisting of suite of deep vision preprocessing algorithms and models, on VM and FaaS platform. Our evaluation shows that migration from monolithic to FaaS platform significantly improves the performance of the application at a reduced cost. © 2020 IEEE.","AI; cloud; FaaS; serverless",,"Chahal, D., Ojha, R., Choudhury, S.R., Nambiar, M., Migrating a recommendation system to cloud using ml workflow (2020) Companion of the ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering, Ser.

Concurrently, advances in artificial intelligence have made the coordination of many such agents possible. However, there is little work considering both the low-level reasoning that allows agents to interpret their environment, such as deep learning techniques, and the high-level reasoning that coordinates such agents. By considering both together, we can better handle real-world scenarios, for example by planning at a high level with low-level uncertainty in mind, or even by improving low-level processing by using high-level reasoning to place the agent in the best scenario for success. © 2019 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

We collect human explanations for commonsense reasoning in the form of natural language sequences and highlighted annotations in a new dataset called Common Sense Explanations (CoS-E). We use CoS-E to train language models to automatically generate explanations that can be used during training and inference in a novel Commonsense Auto-Generated Explanation (CAGE) framework. CAGE improves the state-of-the-art by 10% on the challenging CommonsenseQA task. We further study commonsense reasoning in DNNs using both human and auto-generated explanations including transfer to out-of-domain tasks.

With the rising of deep learning techniques, algorithmic models rival human performances on simple QA, and thus increasingly challenging machine reading datasets have been proposed. Though various challenges such as evidence integration and commonsense knowledge have been integrated, one of the fundamental capabilities in human reading, namely logical reasoning, is not fully investigated. We build a comprehensive dataset, named LogiQA, which is sourced from expert-written questions for testing human Logical reasoning. It consists of 8,678 QA instances, covering multiple types of deductive reasoning. Results show that state-of-the-art neural models perform by far worse than human ceiling. Our dataset can also serve as a benchmark for re-investigating logical AI under the deep learning NLP setting.

From assembly language to present day’s object-oriented programming, concepts came to make programming easier so that a programmer can focus on the logic and the architecture rather than the code and language itself. To go a step further in this journey of removing human-computer language barrier, this paper proposes machine learning approach using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) to convert human language into programming language code. The programmer will write expressions for codes in layman’s language, and the machine learning model will translate it to the targeted programming language. The proposed approach yields result with 74.40% accuracy. This can be further improved by incorporating additional techniques, which are also discussed in this paper. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","LSTM; Machine learning; Machine translation; NLP; RNN; Text to code","Ada (programming language); Brain; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Computer systems programming; Learning systems; Machine learning; Object oriented programming; Assembly language; LSTM; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning models; Machine translations; Natural languages; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Text to code; Long short-term memory","Allamanis, M., Barr, E.T., Devanbu, P., Sutton, C., (2017) A Survey of Machine Learning for Big Code and Naturalness., , http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06182; Birch, A., Osborne, M., Koehn, P., Predicting success in machine translation (2008) In: Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing-Emnlp, 2008, pp. 745-754. , https://doi.org/10.3115/1613715.1613809, pp., October; George, D., Priyanka Girase, N., Mahesh Gupta, N., Prachi Gupta, N., Aakanksha Sharma, N., Navi, V., Programming language inter-conversion (2010) Int.

We demonstrate HEIDL, a prototype HITLML system that exposes the machine-learned model through high-level, explainable linguistic expressions formed of predicates representing semantic structure of text. In HEIDL, human's role is elevated from simply evaluating model predictions to interpreting and even updating the model logic directly by enabling interaction with rule predicates themselves. Raising the currency of interaction to such semantic levels calls for new interaction paradigms between humans and machines that result in improved productivity for text analytics model development process. Moreover, by involving humans in the process, the human-machine co-created models generalize better to unseen data as domain experts are able to instill their expertise by extrapolating from what has been learned by automated algorithms from few labelled data. © 2019 All rights reserved.",,"Computational linguistics; Semantics; Automated algorithms; Evaluating models; Human-in-the-loop; Interaction paradigm; Linguistic expressions; Machine learning communities; Model development; Semantic structures; Deep learning","Bernstein, M.S., Little, G., Miller, R.C., Hartmann, B., Ackerman, M.S., Karger, D.R., Crowell, D., Panovich, K., Soylent: A word processor with a crowd inside UIST; Chen, N., Suh, J., Verwey, J., Ramos, G., Drucker, S., Simard, P., Anchorviz: Facilitating classifier error discovery through interactive semantic data exploration IUI; Cohen, W.W., Yang, F., Rivard Mazaitis, K., Tensorlog: Deep learning meets probabilistic dbs (2017) CoRR; Evans, R., Grefenstette, E., Learning explanatory rules from noisy data (2018) JAIR; Hanafi, M.F., Abouzied, A., Chiticariu, L., Li, Y., Synthesizing extraction rules from user examples with seer (2017) SIGMOD; Jiang, Y., Finegan-Dollak, C., Kummerfeld, J.K., Lasecki, W., Effective crowdsourcing for a new type of summarization task NAACL; Kim, J., Cheng, J., Bernstein, M.S., Ensemble: Exploring complementary strengths of leaders and crowds in creative collaboration CSCW; Krishnamurthy, R., Li, Y., Raghavan, S., Reiss, F., Vaithyanathan, S., Zhu, H., Systemt: A system for declarative information extraction (2009) SIGMOD Record.; Lasecki, W.S., Wesley, R., Nichols, J., Kulkarni, A., Allen, J.F., Bigham, J.P., Chorus: A crowd-powered conversational assistant UIST; Won Lee, S., Zhang, Y., Wong, I., Yang, Y., O'Keefe, S.D., Lasecki, W.S., Sketchexpress: Remixing animations for more effective crowd-powered prototyping of interactive interfaces UIST; Micallef, L., Sundin, I., Marttinen, P., Ammad-Ud Din, M., Peltola, T., Soare, M., Jacucci, G., Kaski, S., Interactive elicitation of knowledge on feature relevance improves predictions in small data sets IUI; Muggleton, S., Learning from positive data (1996) Worshop on ILP.; Pennington, J., Socher, R., Manning, C.D., Glove: Global vectors for word representation (2014) EMNLP; Richardson, M., Domingos, P., Markov logic networks (2006) Machine Learning.; Settles, B., Craven, M., An analysis of active learning strategies for sequence labeling tasks EMNLP; Sherkat, E., Nourashrafeddin, S., Milios, E.E., Minghim, R., Interactive document clustering revisited: A visual analytics approach IUI; Smith, A., Kumar, V., Boyd-Graber, J., Seppi, K., Findlater, L., Closing the loop: User-centered design and evaluation of a human-inthe- loop topic modeling system IUI; Snow, R., O'Connor, B., Jurafsky, D., Ng, A.Y., Cheap and fast-but is it good?: Evaluating non-expert annotations for natural language tasks EMNLP; Yang, F., Yang, Z., Cohen, W.W., Differentiable learning of logical rules for knowledge base reasoning (2017) NIPS",,,"Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations, ACL 2019","28 July 2019 through 2 August 2019",,159207,"ACL - Annu.

In this paper, we describe a dataset and baseline results for a question answering system that utilizes web tables. The dataset is derived from commonly asked questions on the web, and their corresponding answers found in tables on websites. Our dataset is novel in that every question is paired with a table of a different signature, so learning must automatically generalize across domains. Each QA training instance comprises a table, a natural language question, and a corresponding structured SQL query. We build our model by dividing question answering into a sequence of tasks, including table retrieval and question element classification, and conduct experiments to measure the performance of each task. In a traditional machine learning design manner, we extract various features specific to each task, apply a neural model, and then compose a full pipeline which constructs the SQL query from its parts. Our work provides quantitative results and error analysis for each task, and identifies in detail the reasoning required to generate SQL expressions from natural language questions. This analysis of reasoning informs future models based on neural machine learning. © 2019 ACM.",,"Information management; Machine learning; Query processing; Baseline results; Data-sources; Future models; Natural language questions; Neural modeling; Quantitative result; Question Answering; Question answering systems; Natural language processing systems","Bird, S., Klein, E., Loper, E., (2009) Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit, , O'Reilly Media, Inc; Bordawekar, R., Shmueli, O., (2016) Enabling Cognitive Intelligence Queries in Relational Databases Using Low-dimensional Word Embeddings; Chen, D., Fisch, A., Weston, J., Bordes, A., Reading wikipedia to answer open-domain questions (2017) Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 1870-1879. , July; Cheng, J., Reddy, S., Saraswat, V., Lapata, M., Learning structured natural language representations for semantic parsing (2017) Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 44-55. , July; Gardiner, S., Tomasic, A., Zimmerman, J., Smartwrap: Seeing datasets with the crowd's eyes (2015) Proceedings of the 12th Web for All Conference, p. 3; Hayati, S.A., Olivier, R., Avvaru, P., Yin, P., Tomasic, A., Neubig, G., Retrieval-based neural code generation (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 925-930. , Oct.-Nov; Jauhar, S.K., Turney, P., Hovy, E., Tables as semi-structured knowledge for question answering (2016) Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), 1, pp. 474-483; Karki, B., Hu, F., Haridas, N., Barot, S., Liu, Z., Callebert, L., Grabmair, M., Tomasic, A., (2019) Question Answering Via Web Extracted Tables and Pipelined Models, , https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07113, arXiv preprint; Li, X., Roth, D., Learning question classifiers (2002) Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics - Volume 1, COLING'02, pp. 1-7. , Stroudsburg, PA, USA; Pasupat, P., Liang, P., Compositional semantic parsing on semi-structured tables (2015) Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 1470-1480. , July; Pennington, J., Socher, R., Manning, C., Glove: Global vectors for word representation (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1532-1543; Ramos, J.E., Using tf-idf to determine word relevance in document queries (2003) Proceedings of the First Instructional Conference on Machine Learning; Srihari, W.N.I.W.N., Li, R., (1999) Information Extraction Supported Question Answering, , Defense Technical Information Center, Accession Number: ADA460042; Sutskever, I., Vinyals, O., Le, Q.V., Sequence to sequence learning with neural networks (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3104-3112; Tayyar Madabushi, H., Lee, M., High accuracy rule-based question classification using question syntax and semantics (2016) Proceedings of COLING 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers, pp. 1220-1230. , Dec; Waltz, D.L., An english language query answering system for a large relational data base (1978) Communications of the ACM, 21 (7), pp. 526-539; Zhong, V., Xiong, C., Socher, R., (2017) Seq2sql: Generating Structured Queries from Natural Language Using Reinforcement Learning, , CoRR, abs/1709.00103",,"ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD)","Association for Computing Machinery","2nd International Workshop on Exploiting Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Data Management, aiDM 2019 - In conjunction with the 2019 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference","5 July 2019",,152467,"Proc.

Key elements of the TFM are functional characteristics of the system and cause-effect relations between them. Natural Language Processing (NLP) can help in automatic processing of textual descriptions of functionality of the domain. The current research illustrates results of a survey of research papers on identification and extracting cause-effect relations from text using NLP and other techniques. The survey shows that expression of cause-effect relations in text can be very different. Sometimes the same language constructs indicate both causal and non-causal relations. Hybrid solutions that use machine learning, ontologies, linguistic and syntactic patterns as well as temporal reasoning show better results in extracting and filtering cause-effect pairs. Multi cause and multi effect domains still are not very well studied. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

While deep learning models have achieved great success in multimodal tasks like visual question answering, recent studies have shown that they fail to generalize to new inputs that are simply an unseen combination of those seen in the training distribution [6]. In this paper, we propose to tackle this challenge by employing neural factor graphs to induce a tighter coupling between concepts in different modalities (e.g. images and text). Graph representations are inherently compositional in nature and allow us to capture entities, attributes and relations in a scalable manner. Our model first creates a multimodal graph, processes it with a graph neural network to induce a factor correspondence matrix, and then outputs a symbolic program to predict answers to questions. Empirically, our model achieves close to perfect scores on a caption truth prediction problem and state-of-the-art results on the recently introduced CLOSURE dataset, improving on the mean overall accuracy across seven compositional templates by 4.77% over previous approaches. © 2020 Neural information processing systems foundation.

The knowledge contained in the picture is extracted using YOLO, a neural network-based object detection technique, and represented as an answer set program. Natural language processing is performed on the question to transform it into an ASP query. Semantic relations are extracted in the process for deeper understanding and to answer more complex questions. The resulting knowledge-base—with additional commonsense knowledge imported—can be used to perform reasoning using an ASP system, allowing it to answer questions about the picture, just like a human. This framework achieves 93.7% accuracy on CLEVR dataset, which exceeds human baseline performance. What is significant is that AQuA translates a question into an ASP query without requiring any training. Our framework for Visual Question Answering is quite general and closely simulates the way humans operate. In contrast to existing purely machine learning-based methods, our framework provides an explanation for the answer it computes, while maintaining high accuracy. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Answer set programming; Commonsense reasoning; Natural language understanding; Visual question answering","Knowledge based systems; Learning algorithms; Logic programming; Natural language processing systems; Object detection; Semantics; Answer set programming; Base-line performance; Commonsense knowledge; Commonsense reasoning; NAtural language processing; Natural language questions; Natural language understanding; Question Answering; Visual languages","Cao, Q., Liang, X., Li, B., Li, G., Lin, L., Visual question reasoning on general dependency tree (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 7249-7257; Davidson, D., (2001) Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation: Philosophical Essays, 2. , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Gao, H., Mao, J., Zhou, J., Huang, Z., Wang, L., Xu, W., Are you talking to a machine?

A key challenge is to model cyber physical systems at the appropriate level of abstraction while maintaining a clear and understandable linkage between the human designer and the system under design. Fuzzy logic is a framework to synthesize linguistic, natural language requirements into machine learning models. It has been shown that fuzzy logic is a suitable method to learn the behavior of a nonlinear system when a model is not present. The implementation of a constrained fuzzy inference system presented in this paper is a specific class of machine learning architecture that provides a mechanism to relate a system model to human specified requirements. It is not at all dissimilar to more popular neural network architectures. The goal of this paper is to introduce a framework for constrained learning that enables both fast approximation of real valued systems while simultaneously enabling the modeling and analysis of safety properties. This paper focuses on a foundational constrained intelligent learning framework. The framework describes an alternative and constrained machine learning architecture capable of producing highly efficient structures that are also amenable to verification.

However, the inductive bias of these models (formed by the distributional hypothesis of language), while ideally suited to modeling most running text, results in key limitations for today's models. In particular, the models often struggle to learn certain spatial, temporal, or quantitative relationships, which are commonplace in text and are second-nature for human readers. Yet, in many cases, these relationships can be encoded with simple mathematical or logical expressions. How can we augment today's neural models with such encodings In this paper, we propose a general methodology to enhance the inductive bias of NNLMs by incorporating simple functions into a neural architecture to form a hierarchical neural-symbolic language model (NSLM). These functions explicitly encode symbolic deterministic relationships to form probability distributions over words. We explore the effectiveness of this approach on numbers and geographic locations, and show that NSLMs significantly reduce perplexity in small-corpus language modeling, and that the performance improvement persists for rare tokens even on much larger corpora. The approach is simple and general, and we discuss how it can be applied to other word classes beyond numbers and geography. © 2020 The Twenty-Fifth AAAI/SIGAI Doctoral Consortium (AAAI-20).

Users spend a considerable amount of time scrolling through social media feeds to find something relatable, either emotionally or as a problem in their daily life that they want to solve. By analyzing the content produced by social media users, we can know if his opinion is relatively optimistic, neutral, or pessimistic about the subject – that varies from a service, news, a movie, etc. There are multiple approaches for sentiment analysis; first, there’s the Machine learning with its numerous methods that can be either supervised or unsupervised. Second, the Lexicon-based approach. Third, the combination of the two approaches – which is called a hybrid. Also, there are other approaches that we can add to get a more optimized result, such as working on improving text preprocessing techniques or by adding Fuzzy Logic approach and subjectivity detection. In this paper, we continued the same path as in our previous work [1]. We used the same ontologies, the same data collected about Brexit and also the same text preprocessing method. We applied a subjectivity detection using Long Short-Term Memory so that our model can predict subjectivity in a text. We did that by applying a fuzzy logic method based on the Lexicon based polarity and subjectivity classifier to classify the text into one of 5 categories. Finally, we come up with a comparison that summarizes every approach with their result. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Classification; Decision Tree; Fuzzy Logic; Machine learning; Naïve Bayes; Sentiment analysis; Support Vector Machine",,"Ihab, M., Soumaya, L., Mohamed, B., Haytam, H., Abdelhadi, F., Ontology-based sentiment analysis and community detection on social media: Application to Brexit (2019) SCA 2019: Proceedings of the 4Th International Conference on Smart City Applications, pp. 1-7. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3368756.3369090, , pp; Gaikwad, A.S., Mokhade, A.S., Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning and Ontology.

Patterns are represented as conjunctive clauses in propositional logic, produced using bandit-learning in the form of Tsetlin Automata. In this work, we propose a TM-based approach to two common Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, viz. Sentiment Analysis and Semantic Relation Categorization. By performing frequent itemset mining on the patterns produced, we show that they follow existing expert-verified rule-sets or lexicons. Further, our comparison with other widely used machine learning techniques indicates that the TM approach helps maintain interpretability without compromising accuracy – a result we believe has far-reaching implications not only for interpretable NLP but also for interpretable AI in general. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Artificial Intelligence; Interpretable AI; Natural language processing; Rule mining; Semantic analysis; Sentiment analysis","Formal logic; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Semantics; Sentiment analysis; Discriminative power; Frequent itemset mining; Interpretability; Interpretable rules; Machine learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Propositional logic; Semantic relations; Artificial intelligence","Abeyrathna, K.D., Granmo, O.C., Zhang, X., Jiao, L., Goodwin, M., The regression Tsetlin machine-a novel approach to interpretable non-linear regression (2019) Philos.

Text mining approaches that can automatically process and annotate scientific literature with ontology concepts are necessary to keep up with the rapid pace of scientific publishing. Here, we present deep learning models (Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)) combined with different input encoding formats for automated Named Entity Recognition (NER) of ontology concepts from text. The Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text (CRAFT) gold standard corpus was used to train and test our models. Precision, Recall, F-1, and Jaccard semantic similarity were used to evaluate the performance of the models. We found that GRU-based models outperform LSTM models across all evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, considering the top two probabilistic predictions of the model for each instance instead of the top one resulted in a substantial increase in accuracy. Inclusion of ontology semantics via subsumption reasoning yielded modest performance improvement. © 2020 Owner/Author.","automated annotation; deep learning; named entity recognition; ontologies","Big data;

Analogous to natural language, music can be modeled as a sequence of tokens. This motivates the majority of existing solutions to explore the utilization of word embedding models to build music embeddings. However, music differs from natural languages in two key aspects: (1) musical token is multi-faceted-it comprises of pitch, rhythm and dynamics information; and (2) musical context is two-dimensional-each musical token is dependent on both melodic and harmonic contexts. In this work, we provide a comprehensive solution by proposing a novel framework named PiRhDy that integrates pitch, rhythm, and dynamics information seamlessly. PiRhDy adopts a hierarchical strategy which can be decomposed into two steps: (1) token (i.e., note event) modeling, which separately represents pitch, rhythm, and dynamics and integrates them into a single token embedding; and (2) context modeling, which utilizes melodic and harmonic knowledge to train the token embedding. A thorough study was made on each component and sub-strategy of PiRhDy.We further validate our embeddings in three downstream tasks-melody completion, accompaniment suggestion, and genre classification. Results indicate a significant advancement of the neural approach towards symbolic music as well as PiRhDy's potential as a pretrained tool for a broad range of symbolic music applications. © 2020 ACM.","embeddings; representation learning; symbolic music","Deep learning; Dynamics; Context modeling; Genre classification; Hierarchical strategies; Music applications; Natural languages; Embeddings","Alvarez, A.A., Gómez-Martin, F., Distributed vector representations of folksong motifs (2019) Proceedings of the International Conference on Mathematics and Computation in Music, pp. 325-332. , Springer; Böck, S., Schedl, M., Polyphonic piano note transcription with recurrent neural networks (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 Ieee International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, pp. 121-124. , IEEE; Brown, T.B., Mann, B., Ryder, N., Subbiah, M., Kaplan, J., Dhariwal, P., Neelakantan, A., Amodei, D., (2020) Language Models Are Few-Shot Learners, , 2020; Chuan, C.-H., Agres, K., Herremans, D., From context to concept: Exploring semantic relationships in music with word 2vec (2020) Neural Computing and Applications, 32 (4), pp. 1023-1036. , 2020); Chuan, C.-H., Herremans, D., Modeling temporal tonal relations in polyphonic music through deep networks with a novel image-based representation (2018) Proceedings of the 32nd Aaai Conference on Artifcial Intelligence., pp. 2159-2166; Damak, K., Nasraoui, O., (2019) SeER: An Explainable Deep Learning MIDI-based Hybrid Song Recommender System, , arXiv preprint, (2019); Devlin, J., Chang, M.-W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., (2018) BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, , arXiv preprint, (2018); Dong, H.-W., Hsiao, W.-Y., Yang, L.-C., Yang, Y.-H., Musegan: Multi-track sequential generative adversarial networks for symbolic music generation and accompaniment (2018) Proceedings of the 32nd Aaai Conference on Artifcial Intelligence., pp. 34-41; Dong, H.-W., Hsiao, W.-Y., Yang, Y.-H., Pypianoroll: Open source python package for handling multitrack pianoroll (2018) Late-Breaking Demos of the 18th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference; Ferraro, A., Lemström, K., On large-scale genre classifcation in symbolically encoded music by automatic identifcation of repeating patterns (2018) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Digital Libraries for Musicology., pp. 34-37; Herremans, D., Chuan, C.-H., Modeling musical context with word2vec (2017) Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Deep Learning and Music., pp. 11-18; Hirai, T., Sawada, S., Melody2vec: Distributed representations of melodic phrases based on melody segmentation (2019) Journal of Information Processing, 27, pp. 278-286. , 2019; Anna Huang, C.-Z., Duvenaud, D., Gajos, K.Z., Chor-dripple: Recommending chords to help novice composers go beyond the ordinary (2016) Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces., pp. 241-250; Jackendof, R., Parallels and nonparallels between language and music.

Nonetheless, practicing analogical reasoning needs a knowledge-base. The paper proposes a framework for constructing a knowledge-base of urban constructs that builds on an ontology of urbanism. The framework is composed of two modules that are responsible for representing either the concepts or the features of any urban constructs' materialization. The concepts are represented as a knowledge graph (KG) named SpatialNet, while the physical features are represented by a deep neural network (DNN) called SpatialFeaturesNet. For structuring SpatialNet, as a KG that comprehensively conceptualizes spatial qualities, deep learning applied to natural language processing (NLP) is employed. The comprehensive concepts of SpatialNet are firstly discovered using semantic analyses of nine English lingual corpora and then structured using the urban ontology. The goal of the framework is to map the spatial features to the plethora of their matching concepts. The granularity ànd the coherence of the proposed framework is expected to sustain or substitute other known analogical, knowledge-based, inspirational design approaches such as case-based reasoning (CBR) and its analogical application on architectural design (CBD). © 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.","Case-based reasoning (cbr) and case-based design (cbd); Deep neural network for structuring kg; Domain-specific knowledge graph of urban qualities; Natural language processing and comprehensive understanding of urban constructs; Urban cognition and design creativity","Case based reasoning; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge representation; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Regional planning; Semantics; Analogical reasoning; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Design approaches; Design creativities; NAtural language processing; Physical features; Semantic analysis; Spatial features; Architectural design","Ayzenshtadt, V., Espinoza-Stapelfeld, C., Langenhan, C., Althoff, K.-D., Multi-Agent-Based Generation of Explanations for Retrieval Results Within a Case-Based Support Framework for Architectural Design (2018) ICAART; Boden, M.

Any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal may be defined as AI. The family of AI research is rich and varied. For example, cognitive computing is a comprehensive set of capabilities based on technologies such as deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing, reasoning and decision technologies, speech and vision technologies, human interface technologies, semantic technology, dialog and narrative generation, among other technologies. Artificial intelligence and robotics have steadily growing roles in our lives and have the potential to transform vital functions of the society. Organizations benefit from the ability of cognitive systems to improve their expertise quickly and from sharing it to all those who need it. The know-how of top experts is quickly made available to all, when their subject matter expertise is taught to a cognitive system. Through repeated use, the system will provide increasingly accurate responses, eventually eclipsing the accuracy of human experts. With artificial intelligence, comprehension can be outsourced. As the intelligence of machines improve, they will use deep learning to understand the collective information of humankind. With the use of digital sensor data, equipment based on artificial intelligence can used to develop smart advisors, teachers or assistants. As artificial intelligence technology is helping society to advance, there are risks associated with its use, found in the operating systems, hardware, algorithms, system management, ethics and liability, and privacy. The study focuses on artificial intelligence threats and risks and how AI may help to solve cyber security problems.

They provide succinct instructions such as what drugs should be given or taken for a particular condition, how long such treatment should be given, what tests should be conducted, or other situational clinical circumstances for certain diseases. However, as they are described in natural language, they are prone to problems such as variability and ambiguity. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically infer the main components in clinical guideline sentences. Knowing the key concepts in the sentences, we can then feed them to model checkers to validate their correctness. We adapt semantic role labelling approach to mark the key entities in our problem domain. We also implement the technique used for Named-Entity Recognition (NER) task and compare the results. The aim of our work is to build a reasoning framework that combines the information gained from real patient data and clinical practice, with clinical guidelines to give more suitable personalised recommendations for treating patients. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Formal verification; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Text tagging; Therapy algorithms","Hospital data processing; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Clinical guideline; Clinical practices; Named entity recognition; Natural languages; Particular condition; Personalised recommendations; Reasoning framework; Semantic annotations; Model checking","Bäumler, S., Balser, M., Dunets, A., Reif, W., Schmitt, J.: Verification of medical guidelines by model checking – a case study.

The Intensification of Neural Networks in Machine learning playing major revolution in Machine Translation (MT). Looking same aspect, we have prepared a paper on Machine Translation for Hindi using Neural Machine Translation techniques. The Basis of this paper is to translate the source language into target language with the help of sentence structure for source language (English sentence) and corresponding reordering rules for target language (Hindi sentence) using a deep neural network (DNN).When the source input that is English sentences are exactly matched with the target language database then the suitable translation for related input is directly fetched from the database. The fuzzy matching between the input sentence and the sample sentence in the database is done with cosine similarity between the sentence structure of input sentence and the sample sentence and then the reordering rule of the most alike sentence to the input sentence is used for translation.Extracting the structure of the source language sentence and extracting the reordering rule for target sentence is the core part of the translator. Reordering of words in spite of that remains one of the complex problems.It is exciting to implement Deep Neural Network and fuzzy logic to build intelligent reordering rules machine learning system. © 2019 IEEE.","Cosine similarity; Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); Machine learning; Machine translation (MT); Natural Language Processing (NLP); Recurrent Neural Network (RNN); Word2vec","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Database systems; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Fuzzy neural networks; Intelligent computing; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Computational power; Cosine similarity; English sentences; Fuzzy matching; Machine translations; Sentence structures; Source language; Target language; Fuzzy logic","Singh, S.P., Kumar, A., Machine translation using deep learning: An overview (2017) International Conference on Computer, Communications and Electronics; Larochelle, H., Bengio, Y., Louradour, J., Lamblin, P., Exploring strategies for training deep neural networks (2009) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 1. , submitted 12/07; https://deeplearning4j.org/restrictedboltzmannmachine.html; http://www.minerazzi.com/tutorials/cosine-similaritytutorial; http://deeplearning4j.org/word2vec.html; Http://www.Deeplearningbook.Org/; https://www.sas.com/en-us/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html; https://deeplearning4j.org/quickstart; Sivanandam, S.N., Principles of Soft Computing, , 2nd Edition",,"Dr. A.P.J.

However, some application domains, like security or medicine, may need an explanation of this annotation. Explainable Artificial Intelligence is an answer to this need. In this work, an explanation is a sentence in natural language that is dedicated to human users to provide them clues about the process that leads to the decision: the labels assignment to image parts. We focus on semantic image annotation with fuzzy logic that has proven to be a useful framework that captures both image segmentation imprecision and the vagueness of human spatial knowledge and vocabulary. In this paper, we present an algorithm for textual explanation generation of the semantic annotation of image regions. © 2021 IEEE.","Explanation; fuzzy constraint satisfaction problems; natural language generation; semantic annotation","Deep learning; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Image analysis; Image annotation; Semantics; Human users; Image regions; Natural languages; Semantic annotations; Semantic image annotations; Spatial knowledge; Image segmentation","McKinney, S.M., Sieniek, M., Godbole, V., Godwin, J., Antropova, N., Ashrafian, H., Back, T., Shetty, S., International evaluation of an ai system for breast cancer screening (2020) Nature, 577 (7788), pp. 89-94. , 1; Doshi-Velez, F., Kim, B., (2017) Towards A Rigorous Science of Interpretable Machine Learning, , eprint; Miller, T., Explanation in artificial intelligence: Insights from the social sciences (2019) Artificial Intelligence, 2679, pp. 1-38; Waltz, D., Understanding line drawings of scenes with shadows (1975) The Psychology of Computer Vision, , McGraw-Hill; Deruyver, A., Hodé, Y., Brun, L., Image interpretation with a conceptual graph: Labeling over-segmented images and detection of unexpected objects (2009) Artificial Intelligence, 173 (14), pp. 1245-1265; Vanegas Orozco, M.C., Spatial relations and spatial reasoning for the interpretation of earth observation images using a structural model (2011) Theses, Télécom ParisTech, , Jan; Pierrard, R., Poli, J.-P., Hudelot, C., Spatial relation learning for explainable image classification and annotation in critical applications (2021) Artificial Intelligence, 292, p. 103434; Bloch, I., (2013) Fuzzy Models of Spatial Relations, Application to Spatial Reasoning, pp. 51-58. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Li, Y., Li, S., A fuzzy sets theoretic approach to approximate spatial reasoning (2004) IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 12 (6), pp. 745-754. , Dec; Schockaert, S., Cock, M.D., Cornelis, C., Kerre, E.E., Fuzzy region connection calculus: Representing vague topological information (2008) International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 48 (1), pp. 314-331. , special Section: Perception Based Data Mining and Decision Support Systems; Cayrol, M., Farreny, H., Prade, H., Fuzzy pattern matching (1982) Kybernetes, 11 (2), pp. 103-116; Colliot, O., (2003) Représentation, évaluation et Utilisation de Relations Spatiales pour L'interprétation D'images.

However, a major challenge is that code is written using an open, rapidly changing vocabulary due to, e.g., the coinage of new variable and method names. Reasoning over such a vocabulary is not something for which most NLP methods are designed. We introduce a Graph-Structured Cache to address this problem; this cache contains a node for each new word the model encounters with edges connecting each word to its occurrences in the code. We find that combining this graph-structured cache strategy with recent Graph-Neural-Network-based models for supervised learning on code improves the models' performance on a code completion task and a variable naming task - with over 100% relative improvement on the latter - at the cost of a moderate increase in computation time. © 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2019.

But its applicability is limited by the reliance on annotated examples, which are difficult to produce at scale. Indirect supervision has emerged as a promising direction to address this bottleneck, either by introducing labeling functions to automatically generate noisy examples from unlabeled text, or by imposing constraints over interdependent label decisions. A plethora of methods have been proposed, each with respective strengths and limitations. Probabilistic logic offers a unifying language to represent indirect supervision, but end-to-end modeling with probabilistic logic is often infeasible due to intractable inference and learning. In this paper, we propose deep probabilistic logic (DPL) as a general framework for indirect supervision, by composing probabilistic logic with deep learning. DPL models label decisions as latent variables, represents prior knowledge on their relations using weighted first-order logical formulas, and alternates between learning a deep neural network for the end task and refining uncertain formula weights for indirect supervision, using variational EM. This framework subsumes prior indirect supervision methods as special cases, and enables novel combination via infusion of rich domain and linguistic knowledge. Experiments on biomedical machine reading demonstrate the promise of this approach. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Computer circuits; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Modeling languages;

In this paper, we present a two-step method that combines information retrieval techniques optimized for question answering with deep learning models for natural language inference in order to tackle the multiple-choice question answering problem. In the first stage, each question-answer pair is fed into an information retrieval engine to find relevant candidate contexts that serve as the underlying knowledge for the inference models. In the second stage, deep learning architectures are used to predict if a candidate answer can be inferred from the context extracted in the first stage. We deploy multiple deep learning architectures pre-trained on different datasets in order to capture semantic features and to enlarge the scope of the questions we can answer correctly. As it will be described, each dataset used for training the inference models has particular characteristics that can be exploited. In the end, all these solvers are combined in an ensemble model to predict the correct answer. This proposed two-step model outperforms the best retrieval-based solver by over 3% in absolute accuracy. Moreover, the model can answer both simple, factoid questions and more complex questions that require reasoning or inference. © 2019 IEEE.","deep learning; information retrieval; natural language inference; neural networks; question answering","Complex networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Information retrieval; Network architecture; Neural networks; Search engines; Semantics; Complex questions; Ensemble modeling; Learning architectures; Multiple choice questions; NAtural language processing; Natural languages; Question Answering; Question-answer pairs; Natural language processing systems","Zhang, Y., Dai, H., Toraman, K., Song, L., Kg2: Learning to reason science exam questions with contextual knowledge graph embeddings (2018) CoRR, , abs/1805.12393; Schoenick, C., Clark, P., Tafjord, O., Turney, P.D., Etzioni, O., Moving beyond the turing test with the allen ai science challenge (2017) Commun.

Several machine learning (ML) tools are currently being used for direct marketing. However, the disadvantage of ML algorithmic models is that even though results could be accurate, they lack relevant explanations. The lack of detailed explanations that justify recommendations has led to reduced trust in ML-based recommendations for decision making in some critical real-world domains. The telecommunication domain has continued to witness a decline of revenue in core areas such as voice and text messaging services which make direct marketing useful to increase profit. This paper presents the conceptual design of a machine learning process framework that will enable telecom subscribers that should be targeted for direct marketing of new products to be identified, and also provide explanations for the recommendations. To do this, a hybrid framework that employs supervised learning, case-based reasoning and rule-based reasoning is proposed. The operational workflow of the framework is demonstrated with an example, while the plan of implementation and evaluation are also discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Case-based reasoning; Direct marketing; Explainable AI; Machine learning; Telecommunication","Case based reasoning; Commerce; Conceptual design; Decision making; Machine learning; Product design; Telecommunication services; Text messaging; Turing machines; Algorithmic model; Direct marketing; Hybrid framework; Hybrid machine learning; Product offerings; Real world domain; Rule based reasoning; Telecom industry; Marketing","Alanen, A., (2016) Efficient Direct Marketing: Case: Valtapinnoite Oy; Yu, C., Zhang, Z., Lin, C., Wu, Y.J., Can data-driven precision marketing promote user ad clicks?

Users use Twitter to convey their tweet to the general public. The number of Twitter users has reached 330 million people worldwide. Besides that, in Twitter there are tweets that can be sentiments. Sentiment itself can be defined as policy, opinion, logic, or mud, etc. Therefore, sentiment analysis is determining the polarity or type of opinion in a predetermined text or subject. NLP (Natural Language Processing) technique is used to support the beginning of a text. The technique used in an analysis is tokenization sentiment, elimination of stop words, and stemming. This study focuses on developing sentiment analysis using lexicons and multiplication polarity. Accuracy results are still smaller than using machine learning. Therefore, this lexicon needs to be improved in terms of its semantics. © 2019 IEEE.","Lexicon; NLP; Sentiment analysis; Twitter","Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Semantics; Sentiment analysis; General publics; Lexicon; Lexicon-based; Nlp (natural language processing); Social media; Stop word; Tokenization; Twitter; Social networking (online)","Yoo, S.Y., Song, J.I., Jeong, O.R., Social media contents based sentiment analysis and prediction system Expert Syst.

The usage of microtext poses a considerable performance issue to sentiment analysis, since models are trained on standard words. This paper discusses the impact of coupling sub-symbolic (phonetics) with symbolic (machine learning) Artificial Intelligence to transform the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) concepts into their standard in-vocabulary (IV) form. We develop binary classifier to detect OOV sentences and then they are transformed to phoneme subspace using grapheme to phoneme converter. We compare the phonetic and string distance using the Sorensen similarity algorithm. The phonetically similar IV concepts thus obtained are then used to compute the correct polarity value, which was previously being miscalculated because of the presence of microtext. Our proposed framework improves the accuracy of polarity detection by 6% as compared to the earlier model. In conclusion, we apply a grapheme to phoneme converter for microtext normalization and show its application on sentiment analysis. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Concept level sentiment analysis; G2P; IPA; Microtext normalization; Phonetics","Artificial intelligence; Linguistics; Speech analysis; Binary classifiers; Cognitive approaches; Concept levels; Grapheme-to-phoneme converters; Microtext normalization; Performance issues; Similarity algorithm; Social media platforms; Sentiment analysis","Aw, A., Zhang, M., Xiao, J., Su, J., A phrase-based statistical model for SMS text normalization (2006) ACL, pp. 33-40; Beaufort, R., Roekhaut, S., Cougnon, L.A.L., Fairon, C., A hybrid rule/model-based finite-state framework for normalizing SMS messages (2010) ACL, Pp. 770–779.

However, due to the interpretability of deep learning and the emergence of adversarial examples attacks, their reliability has been put into doubt. As for Natural Language Processing, adversarial samples that can be semantically similar to the original ones can also be generated so that NLP classification can be fooled without human observers' attention. In this paper, we give an overview of the existing method in implementing adversarial examples attacks. Firstly, we introduce the implementation of these methods and the damage they impose on the security, integrity, and robustness of NLP systems. Secondly, we discuss problems like the limited attention on the logic of defense, the curse of dimensionality, and the difficulty of implementing white-box adversaries. Finally, to present our opinion on ML security's structure, our discussion upon the standardization of both attack and defense is also included. © 2021 IEEE.","Adversarial Examples Attacks; Deep Learning; Natural Language Processing; Word Embedding","Deep learning; Information systems; Information use; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Current status; Curse of dimensionality; Human observers; Interpretability; Limited attentions; NAtural language processing; NLP systems; Real-world scenario; Data communication systems","Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I., Fergus, R., (2014) Intriguing Properties of Neural Networks; Kurakin, A., Goodfellow, I.J., Bengio, S., Adversarial examples in the physical world (2017) Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations; Jacobs, J.S., Bean, C.P., Fine particles, thin films and exchange anisotropy (1963) Magnetism, 3, p. 271350. , G.

In this preliminary work we present an alternative approach to developing a QA system using machine learning that relies on the automatic generation of a QA grammar from a lemon lexicon. This model-based approach comes with a number of advantages compared to a machine learning approach. First, our approach gives maximum control over the QA interface to the developer of the system as every entry added to the lexicon increases the coverage of the grammar and thus of the QA system in a predictable way. This is in contrast to machine learning approaches where the impact of the addition of a single training example is difficult to predict. A further advantage of our approach is that the QA system operates on the basis of a symbolic grammar that can be used to provide guidance and auto-completion functionality to users. Our system is indeed intended to be used in the context of an auto-completion interface that allows users to ask only questions that the grammar can cover. We present very preliminary results showing that a large percentage of the questions of the training set of QALD-7 can be rephrased in terms of questions that our grammar can parse. We show that with a hand-crafted lexicon, we can in principle get very high micro-F1 scores of 62.5% on the training data of QALD-7 when questions are manually rephrased to fit our grammar. Although these preliminary results do not constitute a proper evaluation of our approach, they hint at the fact that an approach as we propose seems feasible.

The solutions offered by neural networks remain unstable and prone to adversarial attacks: while the percentage of correct answers increases, the incorrect answers often contain glaring errors. Large knowledge graphs contain a lot of facts but little knowledge; they are mostly used for information search and retrieval. The ability to reason conclusions on them is limited, and the majority of modern research turns to approximate methods like neural networks and graph embeddings to draw conclusions and use the accumulated knowledge. In this work, I propose a hybrid cognitive architecture inspired by the observable features of human thinking. Pruning obviously wrong solutions seems to be more natural for human symbolic reasoning than making far-fetched strict logical conclusions, while generating new ideas is often intuitive. So a hybrid cognitive architecture can employ generative neural networks as a sort of ""intuition"" (generating possible solutions) and symbolic inference as a control contour to verify and filter the generated solutions, weeding out dangerous and wrong ideas. This requires creating knowledge graphs containing negative information: the information of what cannot happen or should not be done and why. The problems of creating negative knowledge graphs are discussed. Hybrid cognitive systems using the proposed architecture will be a lot more trustworthy as they will have a system of human-verifiable rules that ensures avoiding the worst errors which can be used in many fields from decision making to natural-language parsing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V..

Currently, providing teachers with detailed feedback about the talk moves in their lessons requires highly trained observers to hand code transcripts of classroom recordings and analyze talk moves and/or one-on-one expert coaching, a time-consuming and expensive process that is unlikely to scale. We created a bidirectional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) network that can automate the annotation process. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this deep learning approach to reliably identify a set of teacher talk moves at the sentence level with an F1 measure of 65%. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

However, multi-hop QA systems pose additional challenges that these memory networks cannot comfortably handle with their attention spans. Path-finding tasks are a flavor of such multi-hop QA, and it does not have the additional complexity of implicit reasoning. A directed knowledge graph of entities, built from any text corpus, can capture both direction and implicit reasoning. This work attempts to address the bottleneck faced by sophisticated memory network implementations on a dataset that is appropriate for solving such path-finding tasks over multiple hops. It uses the knowledge graph approach for the directional information to address the search challenge in path finding. The experiments conducted using this approach have produced impressive results and can be extended in the future for higher-order challenges that consist of implicit reasoning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Attention; bAbI dataset; Dynamic memory network; End to end memory network; Graph linearization; Knowledge graph; Path finding task; Question answering",,"Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., (2014) Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate.

However, most general neural sequence models do not explicitly capture such structural information, limiting their performance on these tasks. In this paper, we propose a new encoder-decoder model based on a structured neural representation, Tensor Product Representations (TPRs), for mapping Natural-language problems to Formal-language solutions, called TPN2F. The encoder of TP-N2F employs TPR 'binding' to encode natural-language symbolic structure in vector space and the decoder uses TPR 'unbinding' to generate, in symbolic space, a sequential program represented by relational tuples, each consisting of a relation (or operation) and a number of arguments. TP-N2F considerably outperforms LSTM-based seq2seq models on two benchmarks and creates new state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies show that improvements can be attributed to the use of structured TPRs explicitly in both the encoder and decoder. Analysis of the learned structures shows how TPRs enhance the interpretability of TP-N2F. © 2020 37th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2020.

One of the most popular technique applied in sentiment analysis of textual content is natural language processing. Sentiment can be evaluated using numerous methodologies like machine learning algorithms and statistical tools but the use of the fuzzy concept is not common. In this paper, we analyze the effect of fuzzification of word polarity sentiment scores. These word scores are obtained by deploying two lexicons: SentiWordNet and AFINN. Experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets: polarity movie dataset by Pang-Lee, IMDB and hotel reviews dataset. The key highlights are: i) proposed an unsupervised fuzzy logic-based approach for sentiment analysis of textual reviews, ii) the proposed model formulated fuzzy cardinality as the measure for the evaluation of word polarity scores, iii) our model has two versions based on the sentiment lexicon deployed in the model, iv) comparison of our fuzzy cardinality approach with other non-fuzzy state-of-the-art methods reveals the superiority of our fuzzy approach. © 2020 IEEE.","AFINN;

It provides the systems with the ability to learn automatically and perform independently without being programmed. When concentrating on the machine learning project choosing an algorithm is one of the most important steps. Machine learning algorithms are the math and logic that adjust the training of the model and the performance. When it comes to a machine learning project the choosing a correct algorithm for implementing the model is a big task. If the developer doesn't choose the suitable and most efficient algorithm for the program the accuracy of the program can be decreased. When we look at these machine learning algorithms there is no solution or no approach that fits for all. Several factors affect when choosing a machine learning algorithm such as the number of data, type of the problem.etc. Most of the time a developer chooses the machine learning algorithm using his prior experience or analyzing several past similar projects. However, when it comes to a beginner it can be a tough experience. Most of the time beginners try with several algorithmic approaches to implement their model without any understanding. However, to avoid this there is no proper solution.Therefore here in this research, proposed an NLP and graph analytics-based approach for recommending a machine learning algorithm for a project. The summary of the proposed solution is here it analyzes past algorithms used in machine learning projects which are stored in a graph using NLP based keyword analysis and recommend the most suitable algorithmic approach. When the user inputs his project idea by using the Natural Language processing it generates keywords for the project description. Thereafter the system analyzes the graph which stores past machine learning projects and used technologies to find the most suitable algorithmic approach to the users' project. Moreover, it shows how the proposed algorithms were used in past similar projects. Therefore by using this system the developers can get a clear idea of the algorithm approach that they need to choose. © 2020 IEEE.","big-data; graph analysis; machine learning; NLP","Graph algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Teaching; Turing machines; User experience; Algorithm approaches; Algorithmic approach; Graph analytics; NAtural language processing; Number of datum; Prior experience; User input; Learning algorithms","Odsc, , https://opendatascience.com/help-set-The-standards-foranalytics-professionals-for-A-chance-To-win-data-science-gifts/, Help Set the Standards for Analytics Professionals For a Chance to Win Data Science Gifts ODSC 12 4 2019 [Accessed 1 5 2020]; Lindner, C., Where Do Data Scientists Come From?

Given a natural language query and a few labeled webpages, our method synthesizes a program that can be used to extract similar types of information from other unlabeled webpages. To handle websites with diverse structure, our approach employs a neurosymbolic DSL that incorporates both neural NLP models as well as standard language constructs for tree navigation and string manipulation. We also propose an optimal synthesis algorithm that generates all DSL programs that achieve optimal F1 score on the training examples. Our synthesis technique is compositional, prunes the search space by exploiting a monotonicity property of the DSL, and uses transductive learning to select programs with good generalization power. We have implemented these ideas in a new tool called WebQA and evaluate it on 25 different tasks across multiple domains. Our experiments show that WebQA significantly outperforms existing tools such as state-of-the-art question answering models and wrapper induction systems. © 2021 ACM.","Program Synthesis; Programming by Example; Web Information Extraction","Air navigation; Computer programming languages; Digital subscriber lines; Natural language processing systems; Extracting information; Language constructs; Monotonicity property; Natural language queries; Optimal synthesis; Question Answering; Synthesis techniques; Transductive learning; Websites","Agarwal, R., Srikant, R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules (1994) Proc.

We use a probabilistic logic programming framework that can learn probabilities for rules from positive and negative example interpretations. These rules are then used by a meta-interpreter to generate an explanation in the form of a proof for a why-question. The explanation is displayed as an answer to the question together with a probability. In certain contexts, follow-up questions can be asked that conditionally depend on these why-questions and have an effect on the probability of the subsequent answer. The presented approach is a contribution to explainable artificial intelligence that aims to take machine learning out of the black-box. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Meta-interpreter; Natural language processing; Probabilistic logic programming; why-questions","Artificial intelligence; Computer circuits; Learning algorithms; Logic programming; Natural language processing systems; Probability; Program interpreters; Black boxes; Follow up; Meta-interpreters; NAtural language processing; Negative examples; Novel architecture; Question answering systems; why-questions; Probabilistic logics","Bellodi, E., Riguzzi, F., Structure learning of probabilistic logic programs by searching the clause space (2015) Theor.

However, the interpretability and accuracy problems have plagued QA systems for a long time. In this paper, we propose a QA system, DSQA, based on knowledge graph for answering domain-specific medical questions. The data we use are from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) that are complex and heterogeneous with varied qualities. We introduce doctor-in-the-loop mechanism to design the knowledge graph, which improves the interpretability and the accuracy of our QA system. For every natural-language question, we generate the answer with a hybrid of the traditional deep learning model and the reasoning on the knowledge graph. Finally, the answer is returned to the user in the format of a subgraph with corresponding natural-language sentences. Our system shows high interpretability and gives excellent performance according to the experiment results. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Causality knowledge graph; Doctor-in-the-loop; EMR; QA System","Deep learning; Information use; Knowledge representation; Medical computing; Natural language processing systems; Electronic medical records (EMRs); Interpretability; Interpretability and accuracy; Knowledge graphs; Medical question answering; Natural language questions; Natural languages; Ordinary people; Medical information systems","Alqifari, R., Question answering systems approaches and challenges (2019) Student Research Workshop, pp. 69-75. , https://doi.org/10.26615/issn.2603-2821.2019011; Ansong, S., Eteffa, K.F., Li, C., Sheng, M., Zhang, Y., Xing, C., How to empower disease diagnosis in a medical education system using knowledge graph (2019) WISA 2019.

A key element of this success has been the development of new loss functions, like the popular cross-entropy loss, which has been shown to provide faster convergence and to reduce the vanishing gradient problem in very deep structures. While the cross-entropy loss is usually justified from a probabilistic perspective, this paper shows an alternative and more direct interpretation of this loss in terms of t-norms and their associated generator functions, and derives a general relation between loss functions and t-norms. In particular, the presented work shows intriguing results leading to the development of a novel class of loss functions. These losses can be exploited in any supervised learning task and which could lead to faster convergence rates that the commonly employed cross-entropy loss. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Learning from constraints; Loss functions; T-Norms","Computer circuits; Deep learning; Entropy; Fuzzy logic; Natural language processing systems; Class of loss functions; Deep structure; Faster convergence; General relations; Generator function; Loss functions; NAtural language processing; Vanishing gradient; Inductive logic programming (ILP)","Bach, S.H., Broecheler, M., Huang, B., Getoor, L., Hinge-loss markov random fields and probabilistic soft logic (2017) J.

In this paper, we propose new question answering (QA) task and dataset for human-robot collaboration on task-oriented operation, i.e., task-oriented collaborative QA (TCQA). Differing from conventional video QA for answering questions about what happened in video clips constrained by scripts and subtitles, TC-QA aims to share common ground for task-oriented operation through question answering. We propose an open-end (OE) format of answer with text reply, image with annotated related objects, and video with operation duration to guide operation execution. Designed for grounding, the TC-QA dataset comprises query videos and questions to seek acknowledgement, correction, attention to task-related objects, and information on objects or operation. Due to the flexibility of real-world task with limited training sample, we propose and evaluate a baseline method based on a hybrid approach. The hybrid approach employs deep learning methods for object detection, hand detection and gesture recognition, and symbolic reasoning to ground question on observation for providing the answer. Our experiments show that the hybrid method is effective for the TC-QA task. © 2020 IEEE.","corpora; human-robot collaboration; hybrid system; multi-modal grounding; question answering","Deep learning; Learning systems; Object detection; Baseline methods; Collaborative application; Human-robot collaboration; Hybrid approach; Learning methods; Question Answering; Real-world task; Symbolic reasoning; Social robots","Dillenbourg, P., Traum, D., Schneider, D., (1996) Grounding in Multi-modal Task-oriented Collaboration, , Oct; Tapaswi, M., Zhu, Y., Stiefelhagen, R., Torralba, A., Urtasun, R., Fidler, S., Movieqa: Understanding stories in movies through question-answering (2016) IEEE CVPR; Lei, J., Yu, L., Berg, T.L., Bansal, M., TVQA+: Spatio-temporal grounding for video question answering (2019) CoRR, , abs/1904. 11574; Yu, Z., Xu, D., Yu, J., Yu, T., Zhao, Z., Zhuang, Y., Tao, D., Activitynet-qa: A dataset for understanding complex web videos via question answering (2019) CoRR, , abs/1906. 02467; Wu, Q., Teney, D., Wang, P., Shen, C., Dick, A.R., Van Den Hengel, A., Visual question answering: A survey of methods and datasets (2016) CoRR, , abs/1607. 05910; Ren, M., Kiros, R., Zemel, R.S., Image question answering: A visual semantic embedding model and a new dataset (2015) CoRR, , abs/1505. 02074; Yu, L., Park, E., Berg, A.C., Berg, T.L., Visual madlibs: Fill in the blank image generation and question answering (2015) CoRR, , abs/1506. 00278; Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Bernstein, M.S., Fei-Fei, L., Visual7w: Grounded question answering in images (2015) CoRR, , abs/1511. 03416; Johnson, J., Hariharan, B., Van Der Maaten, L., Fei-Fei, L., Lawrence Zitnick, C., Girshick, R., Clevr: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning (2017) IEEE CVPR; Wang, P., Wu, Q., Shen, C., Dick, A., Van Den Hengel, A., Explicit knowledge-based reasoning for visual question answering (2017) Proceedings of the 26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1290-1296; Jang, Y., Song, Y., Yu, Y., Kim, Y., Kim, G., TGIF-qa: Toward spatio-temporal reasoning in visual question answering (2017) CoRR, , abs/1704. 04497; Xu, D., Zhao, Z., Xiao, J., Wu, F., Zhang, H., He, X., Zhuang, Y., Video question answering via gradually refined attention over appearance and motion (2017) Proceedings of the 25th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 1645-1653; Colas, A., Kim, S., Dernoncourt, F., Gupte, S., Zhe Wang, D., Soon Kim, D., (2019) Tutorialvqa: Question Answering Dataset for Tutorial Videos; Malinowski, M., Rohrbach, M., Fritz, M., Ask your neurons: A neural-based approach to answering questions about images (2015) CoRR, , abs/1505. 01121; Yang, Z., He, X., Gao, J., Deng, L., Smola, A.J., Stacked attention networks for image question answering (2015) CoRR, , abs/1511. 02274; Andreas, J., Rohrbach, M., Darrell, T., Klein, D., Deep compositional question answering with neural module networks (2015) CoRR, , abs/1511. 02799; Andreas, J., Rohrbach, M., Darrell, T., Klein, D., Learning to compose neural networks for question answering (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, , June; Xiong, C., Merity, S., Socher, R., Dynamic memory networks for visual and textual question answering (2016) Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on International Conference on Machine Learning; Gao, J., Ge, R., Chen, K., Nevatia, R., Motion-appearance co-memory networks for video question answering (2018) CoRR, , abs/1803. 10906; Zhao, Z., Jiang, X., Cai, D., Xiao, J., He, X., Pu, S., Multi-turn video question answering via multi-stream hierarchical attention context network Jul 2018, pp. 3690-3696; Ellebracht, L.D., Ramisa, A., Swaroop Madhyastha, P., Cordero-Rama, J., Moreno-Noguer, F., Quattoni, A., Semantic tuples for evaluation of image to sentence generation (2015) Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Vision and Language, pp. 18-28; Anderson, P., Fernando, B., Johnson, M., Gould, S., Spice: Semantic propositional image caption evaluation (2016) European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 382-398. , Springer",,"The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Signal Processing Society","IEEE Computer Society","2020 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP 2020","25 September 2020 through 28 September 2020",,165772,"Proc.

One of the major challenges that they face is knowledge entailment from the ongoing conversations with a user. Knowledge entailment implies entailing facts that indicate opinions, beliefs, expressions, requests, and feelings of a particular user about a particular target during conversations. The entailed pieces of knowledge will evolve the background knowledge graph of cognitive technologies and advance their contextual inference and reasoning capabilities. Although the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community deals with the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) task, it is treated in a static manner where the predefined hypothesis is typically fed to the learning model, and then the model decides whether it is an entailment or not. However, since the discourse of conversations is dynamic and unpredictable, the traditional RTE approach does not suffice in the context of conversational agents. In this vision paper, we demonstrate our work in progress as to inject background knowledge into machine learning approaches where it entails facts using domain-specific ontologies and contextualized knowledge. Further, we propose investigating solutions for extending or transferring this approach to other domains. We frame our discussion in a case study related to mental health conversations.

Such applications inherently involve huge volume of data, and feeding them as inputs to advanced machine-learning tools ever remains elusive. While the representation of the underlying graph has to be compact, it must also capture aptly the structural diversity of different graphs/networks so that the learning engines can be suitably trained. We observe that two factors are responsible for making this gulf wider. First, a large graph representing real data is memory-strenuous, and may have non-Euclidean attributes; secondly, most of the deep-learning tools perform better on low-dimensional, Euclidean or structured data such as text or graphic images. In this work, we propose a linear encoding of graphs based on Prufer-sequence that provides an efficient mechanism to preserve their structural information.

In almost all sub-fields, artificial neural networks have reached or exceeded human-level performance. However, most of the models are not interpretable. As a result, it is hard to trust their decisions, especially in life and death scenarios. In recent years, there has been a movement toward creating explainable artificial intelligence, but most work to date has concentrated on image processing models, as it is easier for humans to perceive visual patterns. There has been little work in other fields like natural language processing. In this paper, we train a convolutional model on textual data and analyze the global logic of the model by studying its filter values. In the end, we find the most important words in our corpus to our model's logic and remove the rest (95%). New models trained on just the 5% most important words can achieve the same performance as the original model while reducing training time by more than half. Approaches such as this will help us to understand NLP models, explain their decisions according to their word choices, and improve them by finding blind spots and biases. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The crucial task to achieve this is to automatically classify sentences in legal documents into categories based on their content. In this paper, a deep learning model is proposed that breaks down legal documents and classifies the rhetorical types of sentences. A hypothesis is tested, that using a small set of labelled data, deeper and more accurate models for the processing of legal documents can be constructed. This will automate the processing of legal documents hence decreasing, and ultimately eliminating the backlog that currently exists throughout various legal systems. This work can be generalized for legal appeals cases in diverse fields. The various configurations used to train the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model will be compared along with a variety of embeddings. The experiments obtained their highest accuracy using the Bi-LSTM model with 300-dimensional GloVe embeddings compared to the previous techniques used for the semantic understanding of law related documents. © 2020 IEEE.","Bi LSTMs; Classification; Embeddings; Rhetorical role","Authentication; Embeddings; Information retrieval systems; Laws and legislation; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Clearance rates; Diverse fields; Learning models; Legal documents; Legal system; NAtural language processing; Semantic understanding; Deep learning","(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 5th ed., American Psychiatric Association; (2012) Department of Veterans Affairs.

These models are much better than previous models implemented with Symbolic AI so far as their performance is concerned. One revolutionary change in ANN is Convolution Neural Network (CNN).

Library vectors represent libraries by similar context of use as determined by import statements present in source code. Experimental results obtained from training such embeddings on three large open source software corpora reveals that library vectors capture semantically meaningful relationships among software libraries, such as the relationship between frameworks and their plug-ins and libraries commonly used together within ecosystems such as big data infrastructure projects (in Java), front-end and back-end web development frameworks (in JavaScript) and data science toolkits (in Python). © 2019 IEEE.","Information retrieval; Machine learning; Software engineering","Embeddings; High level languages; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Open systems; Search engines; Semantics; Software engineering; Analogical reasoning; Data infrastructure; Embedding technique; NAtural language processing; OR applications; Semantic similarity; Software libraries; Web development frameworks; Open source software","Deshpande, A., Riehle, D., The total growth of open source (2008) Open Source Development, Communities and Quality, Ser.

However, modern AI includes many different techniques, including machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, which are often not able to use knowledge graphs in their full size and complexity. Feature engineering, sampling, and simplification are needed, and commonly achieved with custom preprocessing code. In this position paper, we argue that a more principled integrated approach to this task is possible using declarative methods from knowledge representation and reasoning. In particular, we suggest that modern rule-based systems are a promising platform for computing customised views on knowledge graphs, and for integrating the results of other AI methods back into the overall knowledge model. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,"Data mining; Graphic methods; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Feature engineerings; Integrated approach; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge representation and reasoning; NAtural language processing; Personal assistants; Public knowledge; Question Answering; Formal concept analysis","Aberger, C.R., Tu, S., Olukotun, K., Ré, C., EmptyHeaded: A relational engine for graph processing (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 431-446. , Özcan, F., Koutrika, G., Madden, S.

Differently from many earlier systems with the same aim, the proposed system does not employ templates for the generation task. It assumes that there exist some natural language sentences in the application domain and uses this repository for the natural language description. It does not require, however, a large corpus as it is often required in machine learning approaches. The systems consist of two main components. The first one aims at analyzing the sentences and constructs a Grammatical Framework (GF) for given sentences and is implemented using the Stanford parser and an answer set program. The second component is for sentence construction and relies on GF Library. The paper includes two use cases to demostrate the capability of the system. As the sentence construction is done via GF, the paper includes a use case evaluation showing that the proposed system could also be utilized in addressing a challenge to create an abstract Wikipedia, which is recently discussed in the BlueSky session of the 2018 International Semantic Web Conference. © V.D.

Prior work has been plagued by small traces, limited either by the overheads of dynamic profiling, statically available information [4], or side-exit branches [5]. In this work, we rethink what code path sequences to fuse and construct long traces for offloading to spatial accelerators, while minimizing the occurrence of side exits which limit dynamic coverage. We introduce a novel technique that recasts learning a program's execution patterns as a natural-language-processing problem, CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words). We then use a deep learning network to learn the relationships among paths. During the compilation phase, the compiler uses a sequence miner to decide what paths are likely to occur. The learning network predicts a Deepframe online, which is an extended basic block comprising a multi-path sequence (each path itself is composed of multiple basic blocks). We demonstrate the efficacy of Deepframe on spatial hardware accelerators and find the following: i) Deepframe can construct up to 5x (max: 27x) longer offload regions compared to prior approaches. ii) Surprisingly far-flung ILP (instruction-level parallelism) and MLP (memory-level parallelism) can be mined from the frames statically (5.5x increase in ILP and 10.5x increase in MLP). iii) The frames offloaded to the spatial accelerator have minimal side exits (mis-speculation) and achieve sufficient dynamic coverage to improve overall application performance (up to 9x improvement). We will be releasing open-source our end-To-end compiler prototype based on LLVM. © 2019 IEEE.","compilers; deep learning; machine learning; Prediction; Spatial accelerators; Tracing","Acceleration; Application programs; Forecasting; Inductive logic programming (ILP); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Memory architecture; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Parallel architectures; Program compilers; Application performance; Compiler optimizations; Hardware accelerators; Instruction caches; Instruction level parallelism; Memory level parallelisms; NAtural language processing; Tracing; Deep learning","Sanjay, S.S.L., Patel, J., RePLay: A Hardware Framework for Dynamic Program Optimization (1999) IEEE Transactions on Computers Archive, 50; Ball, T., Larus, J.R., Branch prediction for free (1993) PROC of the 1993 PLDI; Clark, N., Kudlur, M., Park, H., Mahlke, S., Flautner, K., Application-specific processing on a general-purpose core via transparent instruction set customization (2004) PROC of the 37th MICRO; Arnold, M., Fink, S., Sarkar, V., Sweeney, P.F., A comparative study of static and profile-based heuristics for inlining (2000) Proc.

Since ML techniques depend on numerical input representations, word embeddings are increasingly utilized to convert symbolic representations such as text into meaningful numbers. However, a naïve one-to-one mapping of each word in a database to a word embedding vector is not sufficient since it would miss to incorporate rich context information given by the database schema, e.g. which words appear in the same column or are related to each other. Additionally, many text values in databases are very specific and would not have any counterpart within the word embedding. In this paper, we therefore, propose Retro (RElational reTROfitting), a novel approach to learn numerical representations of text values in databases, capturing the information encoded by general-purpose word embeddings and the database-specific information encoded by the tabular relations. We formulate relation retrofitting as a learning problem and present an efficient algorithm solving it. We investigate the impact of various hyperparameters on the learning problem. Our evaluation shows that embedding generated for database text values using Retro are ready-to-use for many ML tasks and even outperform state-of-the-art techniques. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The news websites are publishing the news and provide the source of authentication. The question is how to authenticate the news and articles which are circulated among social media like WhatsApp groups, Facebook Pages, Twitter and other micro blogs & social networking sites. It is harmful for the society to believe on the rumors and pretend to be a news. The need of an hour is to stop the rumors especially in the developing countries like India, and focus on the correct, authenticated news articles. This paper demonstrates a model and the methodology for fake news detection. With the help of Machine learning and natural language processing, author tried to aggregate the news and later determine whether the news is real or fake using Support Vector Machine. The results of the proposed model is compared with existing models.

The Victor robot demands a methodological combination of the reasoning of the areas of software engineering, computer science and Law. For its unprecedented factor, all researchers must develop knowledge in an intense form, while working in different thought process, language and very specific legal texts in a huge volume of data. In a second part, this paper presents some sui generis features of general repercussion as a constitutional filter and a possible field for ontological development for machine learning, and important to understand your potential application at Supreme Court activity. Finally, the article presents some steps of the project that is still in progress, but is already considered the largest artificial intelligence project in the Brazilian judiciary, which has 100 million cases in stock. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

Traditionally, these learning algorithms are implemented in clusters of CPUs and GPUs. But with the increase in data size, the models created on CPUs and GPUs are not scalable. Hence we need a hardware model which can be scaled beyond current data and model sizes. This is where FPGA comes into place. With the advancement of CAD tools for FPGAs, the designers do not need to create the architectures of the networks in RTL level using HDLs like Verilog and VHDL. They can use High-level Language like C or C++ to build the models using tools like Xilinx Vivado HLS. Also, the power consumption of FPGA based models for deep learning is substantially low as compared to GPUs. In this paper, we have done an extensive survey of various implementations of FPGA based deep learning architectures with emphasis on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The CNN architectures presented in the literature consume large memory for the storage of weights and images. It is not possible to store this information in the internal FPGA Block RAM. This paper presents comprehensive servery of the methods and techniques used in literatures to tackle the memory consumption issue and how the data movement between high storage external DDR memory and internal BRAM can be reduced. © 2018 IEEE.","Convolutional neural netwrok; FPGA.","C++ (programming language); Computer aided design; Computer aided logic design; Convolution; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Memory architecture; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Program processors; Random access storage; Speech recognition; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural netwrok; Data movements; Hardware models; Learning architectures; Memory consumption; Memory optimization; NAtural language processing; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Li, H., Fan, X., Jiao, L., Cao, W., Zhou, X., Wang, L., A high performance FPGA-based accelerator for large-scale convolutional neural networks (2016) 2016 26th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL), pp. 1-9. , Aug; Liu, Z., Dou, Y., Jiang, J., Xu, J., Automatic code generation of convolutional neural networks in FPGA implementation (2016) 2016 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology (FPT), pp. 61-68. , Dec; Wang, J., Lin, J., Wang, Z., Efficient hardware architectures for deep convolutional neural network (2018) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, 65 (6). , June; Qiu, J., Wang, J., Yao, S., Guo, K., Li, B., Zhou, E., Yu, J., Yang, H., Going deeper with embedded FPGA platform for convolutional neural network (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays, Ser.

Computational approaches to such structural analysis are still challenging, owing to the fact that the boundary between different harmonic states (such as chord functions) is not explicitly defined in the audio or symbolic music data. It is a novel approach to improve chord recognition by jointly identifying chord change using end-to-end sequence learning. In this paper, we propose the Harmony Transformer, a multi-task music harmony analysis model aiming to improve chord recognition through incorporating chord segmentation into the recognition process. The integration of chord segmentation and chord recognition is implemented with the Transformer, a deep sequential learning model yielding fruitful results in the field of natural language processing. A non-autoregressive decoding framework is also adopted here in aid of concatenating the two highly correlated tasks. Experiments of both chord symbol recognition and functional harmony recognition on audio and symbolic datasets demonstrate that explicitly learning the hierarchical structural information of musical data can facilitate and improve the harmony recognition. © 2020 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.

A sentence-level sentiment analysis using machine learning method and fuzzy logic is used for the work. Using ART classifier, the dataset is trained and monograms in the dataset are divided into eight classes and assigned a score. When the system accepts the input text, monograms in the text are used to find the domain of the text. After identifying the domain by comparing the trained data, the system assigns the scores to the sentences based on the scores of the pre-trained data. The overall score is calculated by adding up the individual scores and identifies whether the text is having positive or negative sentiments. By using fuzzy logic, the polarity of the input is calculated. Since there is no standardized dataset in Malayalam for sentiment analysis, the training data is collected from the Malayalam online newspaper. In short, system identifies the domain of the input text and then finds the sentiment and its polarity. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Association rule tree; Fuzzy logic; Sentiment analysis","Arts computing; Classification (of information); Computer circuits; Intelligent computing; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Domain independents; Individual scores; Machine learning methods; Malayalams; Negative sentiments; Online newspaper; Sentence level; Training data; Fuzzy logic","Anagha, M., Fuzzy logic based hybrid approach for sentiment analysis of Malayalam movie reviews (2015) IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Informatics, Communication and Energy Systems (SPICES); Mukherjee, S., Bhattacharya, P., Sentiment Analysis: A Literature Survey.

But how do we equip machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? Here, we show that applying machine learning to human texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about ""right"" and ""wrong"" conduct. We create a template list of prompts and responses, which include questions, such as “Should I kill people?”, “Should I murder people?”, etc. with answer templates of “Yes/no, I should (not).” The model's bias score is now the difference between the model's score of the positive response (“Yes, I should”) and that of the negative response (“No, I should not”). For a given choice overall, the model's bias score is the sum of the bias scores for all question/answer templates with that choice. We ran different choices through this analysis using a Universal Sentence Encoder. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our social, ethical and even moral choices. Our method holds promise for extracting, quantifying and comparing sources of moral choices in culture, including technology. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Bias in machine learning; Fairness in machine learning; Moral bias; Text-emedding models","Machine learning; Semantics; Human like; Moral bias; Text corpora; Philosophical aspects","Bolukbasi, T., Chang, K.-W., Zou, J.Y., Saligrama, V., Kalai, A.T., Man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker?

Socio-moral reasoning represents a key ability to sustain efficient adaptive social interactions. In the proposed solutions, expert knowledge is first computed using NLP and information retrieval techniques and then added to the DNN architecture using the attentional mechanism. It uses pre-annotated textual data and a coding scheme (SoMoral) applied by experts in psychology. State-of-the-art text classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, etc.) achieved very low results in our context in contrast to LSTM and CNN (when combined with expert knowledge). Our solutions were compared to four models: a CNN-only model, an LSTM-only model, a CNN and an LSTM models where the expert knowledge is concatenated directly with the data (instead of using attention). Experiments show that our models can accurately predict the level of socio-moral reasoning skills. Our findings suggest the need for hybrid neural networks that integrate prior expert knowledge (especially when it is necessary to compensate the strong dependency - of deep learning methods - on data size or the possible unbalanced datasets). © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

Essentially, this task is a text-to-text generation problem but is to learn long text, i.e., greater than 40 words, from a piece of short macro news. Moreover, the core component for human beings to generate financial reports is the logic inference given a piece of succinct macro news. To address this issue, we propose the novel multiple edits neural networks which first learns the outline for given news and then generates financial reports from the learnt outline. Particularly, the input news is first embedded via skip-gram model and is then fed into Bi-LSTM component to train the contextual representation vector. This vector is used to learn the latent word probability distribution for the generation of financial reports. To train this end to end neural network model, we have collected one hundred thousand pairs of news-report data. Extensive experiments are performed on this collected dataset. The proposed model achieves the SOTA performance against baseline models w.r.t. the evaluation criteria BLEU, ROUGE and human scores. Although the readability of the generated reports by our approach is better than that of the rest models, it remains an open problem which needs further efforts in the future. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Financial data mining;

Although these methods have achieved different levels of performance, all of them are still unable to represent all types of building-code requirements. There is, thus, a need to enhance the semantic representations of building codes towards facilitating the representation of all requirements. To address this need, this paper first proposes a new approach to annotate and represent building-code sentences using requirement units that consist of semantic information elements and simple logic operators. To evaluate the proposed building-code annotation approach, this paper also proposes a new natural language generation (NLG)-based method for evaluating annotation quality. The proposed method consists of four steps: data preparation, data preprocessing, NLG model development and training, and sentence evaluation. Sentences from the International Code Council (ICC) building codes were used in the evaluation. © EG-ICE 2020 Workshop on Intelligent Computing in Engineering, Proceedings.

With the development of deep learning techniques, current mainstream text-based CAPTCHAs have been proven to be insecure. Therefore, a major effort has been directed toward developing image-based CAPTCHAs, and image-based visual reasoning is emerging as a new direction of such development. Recently, Tencent deployed the Visual Turing Test (VTT) CAPTCHA. This appears to have been the first application of a visual reasoning scheme. Subsequently, other CAPTCHA service providers (Geetest, NetEase, Dingxiang, etc.) have proposed their own visual reasoning schemes to defend against bots. It is, therefore, natural to ask a fundamental question: are visual reasoning CAPTCHAs as secure as their designers expect? This paper presents the first attempt to solve visual reasoning CAPTCHAs. We implemented a holistic attack and a modular attack, which achieved overall success rates of 67.3% and 88.0% on VTT CAPTCHA, respectively. The results show that visual reasoning CAPTCHAs are not as secure as anticipated; this latest effort to use novel, hard AI problems for CAPTCHAs has not yet succeeded. Based on the lessons we learned from our attacks, we also offer some guidelines for designing visual CAPTCHAs with better security. © 2021 by The USENIX Association.

We show how combining two previously distinct lines of work allows us to better address the challenges resulting from this court's unusual tradition of publishing the opinions of multiple judges with no formal statement of the reasoning (if any) agreed by a majority. We do this by applying natural language processing and machine learning, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), to a data set we created by fusing together expert-annotated sentence labels from the HOLJ corpus of rhetorical role summary relevance with the ASMO corpus of agreement statement and majority opinion. By using CRFs and a bespoke summary generator on our enriched data set, we show a significant quantitative F1-score improvement in rhetorical role and relevance classification of 10-15% over the state-of-the-art SUM system; and we show a significant qualitative improvement in the quality of our summaries, which closely resemble gold-standard multi-judge abstracts according to a proof-of-principle user study. © 2020 The Authors, Faculty of Law, Masaryk University and IOS Press.","Legal Summarisation; Machine Learning; UK House of Lords (UKHL)","Classification (of information); Information systems; Information use; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Conditional Random Fields(CRFs); Data set; F1 scores; Gold standards; NAtural language processing; Proof of principles; State of the art; User study; Laws and legislation","Kanapala, A., Text summarization from legal documents: A survey (2019) Artif Intell Rev, 51, pp. 371-402; Williams, G., Learning the law (2010) Sweet & Maxwell, , 14 edition; Hale, B., (2010) Judgment Writing in the Supreme Court-UK Supreme Court Blog (October); Hachey, B., Grover, C., Extractive summarisation of legal texts (2006) Ai and Law, 14 (4), pp. 305-345; Valvoda, J., Using agreement statements to identify majority opinion in ukhl case law (2018) Proc. 31st Int.

As suggested by many researchers, Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests, which is widely regarded as one of the predominant benchmarks for measuring human intelligence, raises an interesting challenge for AI systems. For better solving IQ tests automatedly by machines, one needs to use, combine and advance many areas in AI including knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, natural language processing and image understanding. Also, automated IQ tests provides an ideal testbed for integrating symbolic and subsymbolic approaches as both are found useful here. Hence, we argue that IQ tests, although not suitable for testing machine intelligence, provides an excellent benchmark for the current development of AI research. Nevertheless, most existing IQ test datasets are not comprehensive enough for this purpose. As a result, the conclusions obtained are not representative. To address this issue, we create IQ10k, a large-scale dataset that contains more than 10,000 IQ test questions. We also conduct a comparison study on IQ10k with a number of state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Unfortunately, commercial purposes often lead to confusion in defining the functionalities of human-machine interfaces (HMIs), whereas such AI tools should have to efficiently imitate or replace human beings and body parts in specific cognitive tasks. Instead, AI is often defined too vaguely, that is, not from an anthropic point of view, and therefore, it remains quite distant from the human activities it tries to imitate. Today, AI is categorized among the cognitive sciences, i.e., those sciences that call upon computational neuro-biology (particularly neural networks), mathematical logic (as a part of mathematics and philosophy), and computer science. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial Intelligence; Formal Semantics; Fuzzy Logic; Lexicon-Grammar; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; NooJ; NooJ FSA/FSTs; NooJ local grammars; Ontologies; Question-answering systems","Computation theory; Natural language processing systems; Body parts; Cognitive science; Cognitive task; Human activities; Human being; Human Machine Interface; Artificial intelligence","Gross, M., (1975) Méthodes En Syntaxe: régime Des Constructions complétives, , Hermann, Paris; Gross, M., Les bases empiriques de la notion de prédicat sémantique (1981) Paris, Langages, 63; Gross, M., (1968) Grammaire Transformationnelle Du français: Tome, 1. , Syntaxe du verbe, Paris, Larousse; Gross, M., (1996) Grammaire Transformationnelle Du français: Tome, 2. , Syntaxe du nom, Paris, Cantilène; Silberztein, M., (2003) The Nooj Manual, , https://www.nooj-association.org; Silberztein, M., (2016) Formalizing Natural Languages: The Nooj Approach, , Wiley, London; Enciclopedia Treccani On-line page. https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/intelligenza-artifi ciale/.

A great deal of attention has been attracted in recent years, toward both science and industry fields for a variety of uses. Machine learning and the text mining uses this most widely known application area of sentiment analysis. This paper presents a framework for efficient multilevel sentiment analysis using fuzzy logic for the classification of online test reviews polarity as strong positive, positive, negative and strong negative. This proposed model can use the fuzzy logic classifier to enhance the degree of sentiment polarity of reviews. Here, fuzzy logic classifier is used for finding the sentiment classes. This also utilizes the mechanism of imputation of missing sentiment for integrating non-opinionated sentences in generating precise results. Results show that the proposed method has a capability of extracting opinions and classify them in an effective way. The proposed method has a capability to predict the degree of sentiment polarity for the reviews on a social media. The better precision and F1-scores are obtained for an objective/subjective classification and polarity (positive/negative) classification on twitter dataset. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Fuzzy logic classification; Machine learning; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis","Classification (of information); Computer circuits; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Text mining; Application area; F1 scores; Fuzzy logic classifiers; On-line tests; Positive/negative; Social media; Fuzzy logic",,"Hegde, N.P.; Vasavi College of EngineeringIndia; email: nagaratnaph@staff.vce.ac.in",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","4th International Conference on Smart Computing and Informatics, SCI 2020","9 October 2020 through 10 October 2020",,262569,"Smart Innov.

The problem at hand not only involves reasoning over visual elements present in the image or natural language understanding of the input query, but also may involve outside world knowledge in order to infer the answer. In this paper, we convert the VQA problem to a factoid question answering task over a set of natural language facts extracted from images in the Visual Genome Dataset [1]. Recent literatures in textual question answering have established the effectiveness of End to End Memory Networks (MemN2N) over the standard LSTMs. Inspired by the approaches incorporated by researchers in this direction, as a first step to create an explainable VQA model, this paper proposes the incorporation of MemN2N with soft attention for inferring the answer from a set of regional facts extracted from the image. We also experiment with the addition of a Bayesian Neural layer for posterior reasoning of the answer from a fixed vocabulary, as proposed in [2] which shows a significant improvement in the accuracy score compared to the other models tested. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Bayesian inference; End to end memory networks; Factoid question answering; Visual question answering",,"Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Shamma, D.A., Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations (2017) Int.

Since ML techniques depend on numerical input representations, word embeddings are increasingly utilized to convert symbolic representations such as text into meaningful numbers. However, those models do not incorporate the context-specific semantics of text values in the database. To significantly improve the representation of text values occurring in DBMS, we propose a novel retrofitting approach called Retro which considers both, the semantics of the word embedding and the relational schema. Based on this, we developed RetroLive, an interactive system, that allows exploring how the retrofitted embeddings improve the performance for various ML and integration tasks. Moreover, the demo includes several interactive visualizations to explore the characteristics of the adapted vectors and their connection to the relational database. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,"Embeddings; Semantics; Visualization; Interactive system; Interactive visualizations; Numerical inputs; Relational Database; Relational schemas; Specific semantics; Symbolic representation; Relational database systems","Alghunaim, A., Mohtarami, M., Cyphers, S., Glass, J., A vector space approach for aspect based sentiment analysis (2015) Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Vector Space Modeling for Natural Language Processing, pp. 116-122; Bojanowski, P., Grave, E., Joulin, A., Mikolov, T., Enriching word vectors with subword information (2017) Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, pp. 135-146. , 2017; Bruni, E., Tran, N.K., Baroni, M., Multimodal distributional semantics (2014) J.

In contrast, other systems provide symbolic linguistic representation, such as phoneme transcriptions into speech. Synthesized speech is generated by bringing together units of recorded speech that are saved in a repository. The speech units, which come in diphones or tablets, differ in size depending on the system. Even though this provides the most comprehensive performance range, it can also require more clarity. The storage of whole words or sentences in explicit usage areas is the foundation of high-quality production. There have been pre-trained end-to-end TTS systems applied to other languages. In this work, we study the use of an end-to-end Tacotron when applied Arabic text. Arabic is morphologically rich and vague, and it has many dialects that vary significantly from one another. There are no official spelling norms in the dialects, and uncorrected standard Arabic includes numerous spelling and grammar errors and hence is a very challenging problem. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

While significant work has been done to model these accelerators and create ways to explore their design spaces and have even incorporated external effects like data transfer latency, they do not account for the portion of the workload running on the CPU. When designing an electronic system under constraints, prioritizing the accelerator can harm the power or performance of the CPU and reduce the overall quality of the design when running workloads with significant components on it. In this work, we present several workloads running on a RISC- V system with an accelerator tailored to each one and show how the overall power, performance, and area can benefit in the presence of constraints by co-designing the two parts. By using this methodology, we show that power, performance, and area can be improved by up to 66%, 40%, and 25 %, respectively, given constraints on each metric. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Constrained optimization; Data transfer; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Program processors; Programmable logic controllers; Application specific; Constrained systems; Electronic systems; General purpose CPUs; Machine learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Overall quality; Transfer latency; Acceleration","Ciregan, D., Meier, U., Schmidhuber, J., Multi-column deep neural networks for image classification Computer vision and pattern recognition CVPR (2012) 2012 IEEE Conference on, pp. 3642-3649. , IEEE; Hannun, A., Case, C., Casper, J., Catanzaro, B., Diamos, G., Elsen, E., Prenger, R., Coates, A., (2014) Deep Speech: Scaling Up End-to-end Speech Recognition, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.5567; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105; Collobert, R., Weston, J., A unified architecture for natural language processing: Deep neural networks with multitask learning (2008) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 160-167. , ACM; Reagen, B., Whatmough, P., Adolf, R., Rama, S., Lee, H., Lee, S.K., Hernández-Lobato, J.M., Brooks, D., Minerva: Enabling low-power, highly-accurate deep neural network accelerators (2016) ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News, 44, pp. 267-278. , IEEE Press; Eldridge, S., Waterland, A., Seltzer, M., Appavoo, J., Joshi, A., Towards general-purpose neural network computing (2015) Parallel Architecture and Compilation (PACT) 2015 International Conference on, pp. 99-112. , IEEE; Huang, S., Xie, Z., Han, J., Zeng, X., A flexible low-power machine learning accelerator for healthcare applications (2016) Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology (ICSICT 2016 13th IEEE International Conference on, pp. 613-615. , IEEE; Qadeer, W., Hameed, R., Shacham, O., Venkatesan, P., Kozyrakis, C., Horowitz, M.A., Convolution engine: Balancing efficiency & flexibility in specialized computing (2013) ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News, 41, pp. 24-35. , ACM; Shao, Y.S., Xi, S.L., Srinivasan, V., Wei, G.-Y., Brooks, D., Codesigning accelerators and soc interfaces using gem5-aladdin (2016) Microarchitecture (MICRO) 2016 49th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on, pp. 1-12. , IEEE; Binkert, N., Beckmann, B., Black, G., Reinhardt, S.K., Saidi, A., Basu, A., Hestness, J., Sardashti, S., (2011) The gem5 Simulator ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News, 39 (2), pp. 1-7; Shao, Y.S., Reagen, B., Wei, G.-Y., Brooks, D., Aladdin: A pre-RTL, power-performance accelerator simulator enabling large design space exploration of customized architectures (2014) ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News, 42, pp. 97-108. , IEEE Press; Thomas, S., Gohkale, C., Tanuwidjaja, E., Chong, T., Lau, D., Garcia, S., Taylor, M.B., CortexSuite: A synthetic brain benchmark suite (2014) Workload Characterization (IISWC) 2014 IEEE International Symposium on, pp. 76-79. , IEEE; Li, S., Chen, K., Ahn, J.H., Brockman, J.B., Jouppi, N.P., Cacti-p: Architecture-level modeling for SRAM-based structures with advanced leakage reduction techniques (2011) Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on, pp. 694-701. , IEEE; Cong, J., Fang, Z., Gill, M., Reinman, G., PARADE: A cycleaccurate full-system simulation platform for accelerator-rich architectural design and exploration (2015) Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) 2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on, pp. 380-387. , IEEE; Roelke, A., Stan, M.R., Risc5: Implementing the risc-v isa in gem5 (2017) First Workshop on Computer Architecture Research with RISC-V (CARRV 2017; Li, S., Ahn, J.H., Strong, R.D., Brockman, J.B., Tullsen, D.M., Jouppi, N.P., Mcpat: An integrated power, area, and timing modeling framework for multicore and manycore architectures (2009) Micro Architecture 2009.

Manual construction of knowledge-bases for complex applications is a time-consuming and expensive process. In such application domains, however, a vast amount of knowledge is available in human-readable format, and it could be leveraged to build knowledge-bases automatically. Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based techniques provide an attractive option for this process. The field of NLP has made rapid strides in last several years and resulted in increased usage across a variety of consumer-facing applications. However, their usage for knowledge-base construction in the aviation industry remains rather limited to date. We present our assessment of using various NLP-based tools for the creation of aviation-focused, high-quality, machine-processable, and human-legible knowledge bases (KBs) for various applications. We identify several gaps, both at the application and fundamental levels, and also identify potential directions for future research that could help overcome the challenges. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

We use Java language to implement finite state machine logic and rule engine, Xml language to describe the finite state transducer rules of the Turkish language, which makes the morphological analyzer both easily extendible and easily applicable to other languages. Empowered with a comprehensive lexicon of 54,000 bare-forms including 19,000 proper nouns, our morphological analyzer is amongst the most reliable analyzers produced so far. The analyzer is compared with Turkish morphological analyzers in the literature. By using LRU cache and a trie data structure, the system can analyze 100,000 words per second, which enables users to analyze huge corpora in a few hours. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

However, the severe impact threat to the algorithm’s performance caused by occlusion still consists of an open issue due to the lack of consistent real-world datasets, richer annotations, and evaluations in the specific occlusion problem. Therefore, unlike previous works in this field, our paper addresses occlusions in scene text recognition. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of existing deep architectures for scene text detection and recognition in various occlusion levels. First, we investigated state-of-the-art scene text and recognition methods and evaluated these current deep architectures performances on ICDAR 2015 dataset without any generated occlusion. Second, we created a methodology to generate large datasets of scene text in natural images with ranges of occlusion between 0 and 100%. From this methodology, we produced the ISTD-OC, a dataset derivated from the ICDAR 2015 database to evaluate deep architectures under different levels of occlusion. The results demonstrated that these existing deep architectures that have achieved state-of-the-art are still far from understanding text instances in a real-world scenario. Unlike the human vision systems, which can comprehend occluded instances by contextual reasoning and association, our extensive experimental evaluations show that current scene text recognition models are inefficient when high occlusions exist in a scene. Nevertheless, for scene text detection, segmentation-based methods, such as PSENet and PAN, are more robust in predicting higher levels of occluded texts. In contrast, methods that detect at the character level, such as CRAFT, are unsatisfactory to heavy occlusions. When it comes to recognition, attention-based methods that benefit contextual information have performed better than CTC-based methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deep learning; Occlusion; Text scenes","Character recognition; Computer vision; Deep learning; Deep architectures; Deep learning; Natural images; Occlusion; Performance; Scene Text; State of the art; Text detection; Text recognition; Text scene; Large dataset","Adak, C., Chaudhuri, B.B., Blumenstein, M., Impact of struck-out text on writer identification (2017) 2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Pp. 1465–1471.

In this work, we propose the design of an explainable, human-in-the-loop, and interactive personal assistant system. The assistant will help a Systems Engineer in their daily work environment through complex information management and high-level question-answering to augment their problem-solving abilities. We describe the fundamental characteristics of the assistant by understanding operational, functional, and system requirements from Systems Engineers and NASA’s Systems Engineering Handbook. The assistant is designed to act as a workbench to manage dynamic information about projects and analyze hypothetical scenarios. It is also designed to make logical inferences and perform temporal reasoning by handling domain information and information related to schedule and resources. In addition, the system learns new information over time by interacting with its user and can perform case-based reasoning from previous experiences. The knowledge base design describes a novel hybrid approach to build a domain-independent common-sense framework with which domain-specific engineers can attune it and build their projects. Using these specific objectives and constraints, the architecture of a personal assistant is proposed. Main contributions of this design paper are Systems Engineering (SE) domain analysis, a survey of existing research, preliminary experiments using the state-of-the-art systems to explore the feasibility, a proposal of a complete architecture with component level detail, and identification of areas that require further research and development.

In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to the joint modeling and interdependent fulfilment of both tasks. In particular, document clustering and topic modeling are seamlessly interrelated under an innovative Bayesian generative model of clusters, topics and contents in text corpora. Such a model assumes that text corpora result from a generative process, in which clusters and topics act as connected latent factors. Essentially, clusters are initially associated with descriptive and actionable topic distributions, that enforce cluster coherence. The individual documents are then assigned to one respective cluster and worded accordingly. Under the devised model, document clustering and topic modeling can be simultaneously performed in an interdependent manner simply by Bayesian reasoning. For this purpose, the mathematical details regarding collapsed Gibbs sampling as well as parameter estimation are derived and implemented into an approximate inference algorithm. Comparative experiments on standard benchmark text corpora reveal the effectiveness of our approach at jointly clustering text documents and unveiling their semantics in terms of coherent topics. © 2019 IEEE.","Bayesian Text Analysis; Document Clustering; Topic Modeling","Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Inference engines; Information retrieval; Semantics; Approximate inference; Bayesian generative models; Comparative experiments; Document Clustering; Machine learning approaches; Mathematical details; Text analysis; Topic Modeling; Text mining","Aggarwal, C., Zhai, C., (2012) A Survey of Text Clustering Algorithms, pp. 77-128. , C.

Dynamic workflows are being used increasingly due to their flexibility in a working environment where they minimize mundane tasks like long-term maintenance and increase productivity by automatically responding to changes and introducing new processes. Constant changes within unstable environments where information may be sparse, inconsistent and uncertain can create a bottleneck to a workflow in predicting behaviours effectively. Within a business environment, automatic applications like customer support, complex incidents can be regarded as instances of a dynamic process since mitigation policies have to be responsive and adequate to any case no matter its unique nature. Support engineers work with any means at their disposal to solve any emerging case and define a custom prioritization strategy, to achieve the best possible result. This paper describes a novel workflow architecture for heavy knowledge-related application workflows to address the tasks of high solution accuracy and shorter prediction resolution time. We describe how policies can be generated against cases deriving from heterogeneous workflows to assist experts and domain-specific reusable cases can be generated for similar problems. Our work is evaluated using data from real business process workflows across a large number of different cases and working environments. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Business processes; Case-Based Reasoning; Deep learning; Natural language processing","Computer software reusability; Deep learning; Memory architecture; Natural language processing systems; Automatic application; Business environments; Business Process; Long-term maintenances; Mitigation policies; NAtural language processing; Shorter prediction; Working environment; Case based reasoning","Kapetanakis, S., Petridis, M., Knight, B., Ma, J., Bacon, L., A case based reasoning approach for the monitoring of business workflows (2010) ICCBR 2010.

Yet there has been evidence that current benchmark datasets suffer from bias, and current state-of-the-art models cannot be easily evaluated on their intermediate reasoning process. To address these issues and complement similar efforts in visual question answering, we build CLEVR-Ref+, a synthetic diagnostic dataset for referring expression comprehension. The precise locations and attributes of the objects are readily available, and the referring expressions are automatically associated with functional programs. The synthetic nature allows control over dataset bias (through sampling strategy), and the modular programs enable intermediate reasoning ground truth without human annotators. In addition to evaluating several state-of-the-art models on CLEVR-Ref+, we also propose IEP-Ref, a module network approach that significantly outperforms other models on our dataset. In particular, we present two interesting and important findings using IEP-Ref: (1) the module trained to transform feature maps into segmentation masks can be attached to any intermediate module to reveal the entire reasoning process step-by-step; (2) even if all training data has at least one object referred, IEP-Ref can correctly predict no-foreground when presented with false-premise referring expressions.

Elaborated feedback is thus a challenge for AI in education systems because it requires dynamic explanations, which traditionally require logical reasoning and knowledge engineering to generate. This study presents an alternative approach that formulates elaborated feedback in terms of long-form question answering (LFQA). An off-the-shelf LFQA system was evaluated by human raters in a 2x2x2x2 ablation design that manipulated the context documents given to the LFQA model and the post-processing of model output. Results indicate that context manipulations improve performance but that post-processing can have detrimental results. © 2021 ACM.","deep learning; elaborated feedback; human evaluation; information retrieval; natural language generation; question answering","Ablation; Education systems; Improve performance; Logical reasoning; Model outputs; Post processing; Question Answering; Education computing","Aleven, V., McLaren, B., Roll, I., Koedinger, K., Toward tutoring help seeking (2004) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, James C.

It also presents the results of a study that allows catching linguistic patterns for extrapunitive responses (E-reactions) aimed at protecting the “Self”; and shows the results of experiments with the Rosenzweig picture-frustration test protocols. We use a linguistic analyzer, “PCA Machine”, which considers the wide range of multi-level features aggregated by the relational-situational model to process the texts with E-reactions to frustration. Then we developed a set of templates, which can catch the revealed linguistic patterns and use them together with machine learning models. This approach turns out to be new for modeling the reasoning of expert cognitive research. Experimental results show that in most cases, the templates allow detecting E-reactions. Moreover, the share of unrecognized reactions is small; however, to increase the recognition reliability, it is necessary to consider additional features, including the context of the analyzed text fragments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Linguistic template; Reaction on frustration; Relational-situational analysis; Rosenzweig picture-frustration study","Artificial intelligence; Linguistics; Automated recognition; Automatic recognition; Linguistic patterns; Machine learning models; Multilevels; Situational modeling; Test protocols; Text fragments; Character recognition","Rosenzweig, S., Types of reaction to frustration (1934) J.

Word problems are any numerical problems written in natural languages like English, based on any subject domain (mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, etc.), and MWPs relate to word problems in the mathematics domain. Solving MWPs has been a long-lasting open research problem in the field of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligent (AI); however, unlike other research problems in NLP, ML, and AI, it has not made much progress. MWPs which can be easily solved by second-grade students can often pose serious challenges to MWP solvers due to its diverse problem types and varying degree of complexities. Understanding such problems written in natural language requires proper reasoning toward equation formation and answer generation. We restrict the review in this survey only to research on solving arithmetic word problems from elementary school level mathematics. We analyzed all the important methodologies proposed by researchers along with the datasets they used for training and evaluation. We studied the technical aspects of the system components and the algorithms relevant to their research along with the scopes, constraints, and limitations. This review paper also discusses the performance of different MWP solvers and provides observations on related datasets. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,"Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Artificial intelligent; Degree of complexity; Elementary schools; Natural languages; Numerical problems; Research problems; System components; Technical aspects; Problem solving","Bakman, Y., (2007) Robust Understanding of Word Problems with Extraneous Information, , arXiv; Bobrow, D.G., (1964) Natural Language Input for a Computer Problem Solving System; Briars, D.J., Larkin, J.H., An integrated model of skill in solving elementary word problems (1984) Cognit.

There is an opportunity for AI Planning to be applied, which offers reasoning about action trajectories to help build automation blueprints. AI Planning is a problem-solving technique, where knowledge about available actions and their consequences is used to identify a sequence of actions, which, when applied in a given initial state, satisfy a desired goal. AI Planning has successfully been applied in a number of domains ranging from space applications, logistics and transportation, manufacturing, robotics, scheduling, e-learning, enterprise risk management, and service composition. In this paper, we discuss experience in building automation solutions that employ AI planning for use in enterprise IT and business services, such as change and event management, migration and transformation and RPA composition.

Especially, the HTML contents contain valuable information about the individual health condition and graph knowledge presents the semantics of words in the contents. This paper focuses on combining these two for extracting causality knowledge. Understanding causality relations is one of the crucial tasks to support building an Artificial Intelligent (AI) enabled healthcare system. Unlike other raw data sources used by AI processes, the causality semantic dataset is generated in this paper, which is believed to be more efficient and transparent for supporting AI tasks. Currently, neural network-based deep learning processes found themselves in a hard position to explain the prediction outputs, which is majorly because of lacking knowledge-based probability analysis. Dynamic probability analysis based on causality modeling is a new research area that not only can model the knowledge in a machine-understandable way but also can create causal probability relations inside the knowledge. To achieve this, a causal probability generation framework is proposed in this paper that extends the current Description Logic (DL), applies semantic Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach, and calculates runtime causal probabilities according to the given input conditions. The framework can be easily implemented using existing programming standards. The experimental evaluations extract 383 common disease conditions from the UK NHS (the National Health Service) and enable automatically linked 418 condition terms from the DBpedia dataset.

Due to the complex features of the real-world tasks, current LSTM models become increasingly bigger and more complicated for enhancing the learning ability and prediction accuracy. However, through our in-depth characterization on the state-of-the-art general-purpose deep-learning accelerators, we observe that the LSTM training execution grows inefficient in terms of storage, performance, and energy consumption, under an increasing model size. With further algorithmic and architectural analysis, we identify the root cause for large LSTM training inefficiency: massive intermediate variables. To enable a highly-efficient LSTM training solution for the ever-growing model size, we exploit some unique memory-saving and performance improvement opportunities from the LSTM training procedure, and leverage them to propose the first cross-stack training solution, η-LSTM, for large LSTM models. η-LSTM comprises both software-level and hardware-level innovations that effectively lower the memory footprint upper-bound and excessive data movements during large LSTM training, while also drastically improving training performance and energy efficiency. Experimental results on six real-world large LSTM training benchmarks demonstrate that η-LSTM reduces the required memory footprint by an average of 57.5% (up to 75.8%) and brings down the data movements for weight matrices, activation data, and intermediate variables by 40.9%, 32.9%, and 80.0%, respectively. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art GPU implementation for LSTM training by an average of 3.99× (up to 5.73×) on performance and 2.75× (up to 4.25) on energy. We hope this work can shed some light on how to design high logic utilization for future NPUs. © 2021 IEEE.","Accelerator; Machine Learning; Neural nets; Recurrent Neural Network","Deep learning; Digital storage;

The reason behind this is that matching patient information to the eligibility criteria for clinical trials is a manual, effort-consuming process. Therefore, automating this process is an essential step in improving the number of patients participating in clinical research. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for automated patients to clinical trials matching. The matching process is based on measuring the similarity score between phrases extracted from patient medical records and the eligibility criterion for a trial. Our solution is based on a combination of NLP techniques and modern deep learning-based NLP models. In this context, we follow pre-training and transfer learning approaches to help the model learn task-specific reasoning skills. Additionally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on large Medical Natural Language Inference (MedNLI) and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS-B) datasets. The matching process was performed at semantic phrases level by converting patient information and trial criteria into vector representations. We then used a scoring function that combined cosine similarity and scaling normalization to identify potential patient-trial matches. The experimental results have shown that our framework is highly effective in sorting out patients by their similarity scores. Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

Maestro reduces under-utilization common for a single large SA by allowing parallel use of many smaller SAs on DNN weight matrices of varying shapes and sizes. In order to buffer immediate results in memory blocks (MBs) and provide coordinated high-bandwidth communication between SAs and MBs in transferring weights and results Maestro employs three innovations. (1) An SA on the logic die can access its corresponding MB on the memory die in short distance using 3D-IC interconnects, (2) through an efficient switch based on H-trees, an SA can access any MB with low latency, and (3) the switch can combine partial results from SAs in an elementwise fashion before writing back to a destination MB. We describe the Maestro architecture, including a circuit and layout design, detail scheduling of the switch, analyze system performance for real-time inference applications using input with batch size equal to one, and showcase applications for deep learning inference, with ShiftNet for computer vision and recent Transformer models for natural language processing. For the same total number of systolic cells, Maestro, with multiple smaller SAs, leads to 16x and 12x latency improvements over a single large SA on ShiftNet and Transformer, respectively. Compared to a floating-point GPU implementation of ShiftNet and Transform, a baseline Maestro system with 4,096 SAs (each with 8x8 systolic cells) provides significant latency improvements of 30x and 47x, respectively. © 2019 IEEE.","Combining switch; Computer architecture; Convolutional neural network; Deep neural network; Memory-on-logic 3D-IC; Systolic arrays; Transformer","Computer architecture; Computer circuits; Deep neural networks; Digital arithmetic; Memory architecture; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Parallel architectures; Three dimensional integrated circuits; Combining switches; Convolutional neural network; High bandwidth communication; Memory on logic; NAtural language processing; Real-time inference; Transformer; Transformer models; Systolic arrays","Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., Devin, M., Isard, M., Tensorflow: A system for largescale machine learning (2016) 12th {USENIX} Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation ({OSDI} 16), pp. 265-283; Clos, C., A study of non-blocking switching networks (1953) Bell System Technical Journal, 32 (2), pp. 406-424; Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database CVPR '09; Gao, M., Pu, J., Yang, X., Horowitz, M., Tetris: Scalable and efficient neural network acceleration with 3d memory ASPLOS '17; Gupta, S., Agrawal, A., Gopalakrishnan, K., Narayanan, P., Deep learning with limited numerical precision ICML '15; Jouppi, N.P., Young, C., Patil, N., Patterson, D., In-datacenter performance analysis of a tensor processing unit ISCA '17; Kim, D., Kung, J., Chai, S., Yalamanchili, S., Mukhopadhyay, S., Neurocube: A programmable digital neuromorphic architecture with high-density 3d memory ISCA '16; Kung, H.T., McDanel, B., Zhang, S.Q., Packing sparse convolutional neural networks for efficient systolic array implementations: Column combining under joint optimization ASPLOS '19; Kung, H.T., McDanel, B., Zhang, S.Q., Systolic building block for logic-on-logic 3d-ic implementations of convolutional neural networks ISCAS '19; Lin, D., Talathi, S., Annapureddy, S., Fixed point quantization of deep convolutional networks (2016) International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 2849-2858; McDanel, B., Zhang, S.Q., Kung, H.T., Dong, X., Full-stack optimization for accelerating cnns using powers-of-two weights with FPGA validation ICS '19; Papineni, K., Roukos, S., Ward, T., Zhu, W.-J., Bleu: A method for automatic evaluation of machine translation ACL '02; Paszke, A., Gross, S., Chintala, S., Chanan, G., Yang, E., DeVito, Z., Lin, Z., Lerer, A., Automatic differentiation in pytorch (2017) NIPS-W; Peters, M.E., Neumann, M., Iyyer, M., (2018) Deep Contextualized Word Representations; Radford, A., Wu, J., Child, R., Luan, D., Amodei, D., Sutskever, I., (2019) Language Models Are Unsupervised Multitask Learners; Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A.N., Kaiser, P.I., Attention is all you need (2017) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 5998-6008; Wu, B., Wan, A., Yue, X., Jin, P., Shift: A zero flop, zero parameter alternative to spatial convolutions CVPR '18; (2018) Accelerating Dnns with Xilinx Alveo Accelerator Cards, , Xilinx Technical report, Xilinx, October",,"Deepoly;et al.;FutureWei Technologies, Inc.;IMO Ventures;Sensetime;WITINMEM","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","30th IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors, ASAP 2019","15 July 2019 through 17 July 2019",,151785,"Proc Int Conf Appl Spec Syst Arcitec Process Proc",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072608120

Current applications for natural language processing range from real-time translation of spoken language through automated discovery of sentiment in online postings to conversational agents embedded in everyday devices. Recent developments in machine learning, combined with the availability of large amounts of labelled training data, have enabled non-structural approaches to surpass classical techniques based on formal grammars, conceptual ontologies and symbolic representations. As the complexity and opaqueness of those stochastic models become more and more evident, however, the question arises if we trade gains in observable performance with a literal loss of understanding. The cybernetic”black box” (Ross Ashby) re-appears as the other participant in the medium of communication. This development, if unchecked, might have fundamental ramifications for the relationship between humans and machines. In this article I present a distinction-based approach to propose a way towards a comprehensive model of communication. First, I critically revisit fundamental concepts traditionally observed by AI research such as information vs. communication, simulation vs. performance and language vs. cognition. I also highlight a few of the contradictory phenomena that we can observe today as a consequence of these choices. Then I make the case for a different set of distinctions. First I consult Niklas Luhmann's sociological theory in order to locate communication firmly within social systems as opposed to minds or organisms. In addition, I propose to make use of Friedemann Schulz von Thun's four-sided model in order to capture aspects of communication that are currently neglected. Finally I advocate for a transdisciplinary approach to explore the full context of communication between humans and machines. © 2019 AISB Convention.All right reserved.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computational grammars; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Stochastic systems; Classical techniques; Communication problems; Conversational agents; Fundamental concepts; NAtural language processing; Sociological theories; Symbolic representation; Trans-disciplinary approaches; Stochastic models","Allen, J.F., (1995) Natural Language Understanding, , Benjamin/Cummings, Redwood City, Calif., 2. ed., 3rd print edn, OCLC: 245657643; Allwood, J., A bird's eye view of pragmatics (1978) Papers from the Fourth Scandinavian Conference of Linguistics, pp. 145-159. , Kirsten Gregersen,.

Recently, many researchers have proposed deep learning based models to learn both speaker-context and sentence-context information interactions. However, the existing models generally learn the sentiment-context interactions by simple non-linear function, which does not focus on affective reasoning and is lack of interpretability. To address those issues, we introduce probabilistic graph model (PGM). Inspired by the interaction matrix of the Coupled HMM, we propose a novel interaction matrix based improvement for output gating mechanism, which contains local 2-order sentiment-context interaction. Then we propose the interaction matrix Based Long Short-Term Memory Network (ConvLSTM), which captures local sentiment-context interactions. Next, inspired by the reasoning of PGM, we develop a novel PGM layer to model global high-order sentiment-context interaction for sentiment label sequence. Finally, we propose PGM Based Hierarchical Affective Reasoning Network (PHARN), which can learn both local and global sentiment-context interaction. Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks. © 2021 IEEE.","conversational sentiment analysis; hierarchical affective reasoning; probabilistic graph model","Big data; Deep learning; Functions; Graph theory; Sentiment analysis; Context information; Gating mechanisms; Interaction matrices; Interpretability; Learning Based Models; Nonlinear functions; Probabilistic graph models; Short term memory; Matrix algebra","Poria, S., Majumder, N., Mihalcea, R., Emotion recognition in conversation: Research challenges, datasets, and recent advances[J] (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 100943-100953; Poria, S., Cambria, E., Hazarika, D., Majumder, N., Zadeh, A., Morency, L.-P., Context-dependent sentiment analysis in user-generated videos (2017) ACL.; Hazarika, D., Poria, S., Zadeh, A., Cambria, E., Morency, L.-P., Zimmermann, R., Conversational memory network for emotion recognition in dyadic dialogue videos (2018) NAACL.; Jiao, W., Yang, H., King, I., Lyu, M.R., HiGRU: Hierarchical gated recurrent units for utterance-level emotion recognition (2019) NAACL-HLT (1), pp. 397-406; Hazarika, D., Poria, S., Mihalcea, R., Cambria, E., Zimmermann, R., ICON: Interactive conversational memory network for multimodal emotion detection (2018) EMNLP.; Majumder, N., Poria, S., Hazarika, D., Mihalcea, R., Gelbukh, A., Cambria, E., DialogueRNN: An attentive rnn for emotion detection in conversations (2019) Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 33, pp. 6818-6825; Deepanway, G., Navonil, M., Soujanya, P., Ni, C., Alexander, G., (2019) DialogueGCN: A Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Emotion Recognition in Conversation, pp. 154-164; Zhang, D., Wu, L., Sun, C., Li, S., Zhu, Q., Zhou, G., Modeling both context-and speaker-sensitive dependence for emotion detection in multi-speaker conversations (2019) IJCAI, pp. 5415-5421; Liu, W., Wen, Y., Yu, Z., Large-margin softmax loss for convolutional neural networks[c] (2016) ICML., pp. 507-516; Shi, Z., Joydeep, G., (2021) A New Formulation of Coupled Hidden Markov Models; Matthew, B., (1997) Coupled Hidden Markov Models for Modeling Interacting Processes; Huang, Z., Xu, W., Yu, K., Bidirectional lstm-crf models for sequence tagging[J] (2015) Computer Science; Lafferty, J., McCallum, A., Pereira, F., Conditional random fields: Probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequence data (2001) Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML., 1; McCallum, A., Freitag, D., Pereira, F.C.N., Maximum entropy markov models for information extraction and segmentation (2000) Icml., 17; Jianlin, S., (2020) CRF Used, Might As Well Know the Next Faster MEMM?

As software developers are moving from big upfront design to an evolutionary or emerging design, the architecture of a system evolves as more functionality is added. In agile software development, functional user requirements are often expressed as user stories. Quality attributes might be implicitly referenced in user stories. To support a more systematic analysis and reasoning about quality attributes in agile development projects, this paper explores how to automatically identify quality attributes from user stories. This could help better understand relevant quality attributes (and potential architectural key drivers) before analysing product backlogs and domains in detail and provides the 'bigger picture' of potential architectural drivers for early architecture decision making. The goal of this paper is to present our vision and preliminary work towards understanding whether user stories do include information about quality attributes at all, and if so, how we can identify such information in an automated manner. © 2019 IEEE.","agile software development; decision making; machine learning; natural language processing; software architecture","C (programming language); Computer architecture; Computer software selection and evaluation; Decision making; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Software architecture; Agile software development; Architectural drivers; Architecture decisions; NAtural language processing; Software architecture design; Software developer; Software quality attributes; Systematic analysis; Software design","Bass, L., Klein, M., Bachmann, F., Quality attribute design primitives and the attribute driven design method (2002) Software Product-Family Engineering, pp. 169-186. , F. van der Linden, Ed.

Research has shown that if affective computing technologies and machine learning mechanisms can be introduced to enhance interaction and feedback between ISRs and users, ISRs may be better aligned with both the service scenarios and the future development of innovative services. Based on an interdisciplinary integration framework, this study combined the concept and methodologies of design thinking, emotion detection technologies, and case-based reasoning (CBR), based on the use case of a simulated interview for empirical research, and developed a prototype emotion-sensing robot (ESR) system for the planning and testing of emotion sensing. Three emotion detection and analysis indicators, namely, happiness index of facial expressions, blink rate, and semantic emotions conveyed by the text on their resume, were proposed as the basis for analyzing emotional perception in this study.

In this paper, we present a complete methodology to address this important task, by designing strategies that process the different components involved in the system.

This is a non-trivial task that involves common-sense reasoning. However, existing efforts rely on hand-crafted features to extract the workflow graph from recipes due to the lack of large-scale labeled datasets. Moreover, they fail to utilize the cooking images, which constitute an important part of food recipes. In this paper, we build MM-ReS, the first large-scale dataset for cooking workflow construction, consisting of 9,850 recipes with human-labeled workflow graphs. Cooking steps are multi-modal, featuring both text instructions and cooking images. We then propose a neural encoder-decoder model that utilizes both visual and textual information to construct the cooking workflow, which achieved over 20% performance gain over existing hand-crafted baselines. © 2020 ACM.","cause-and-effect reasoning; cooking workflow; deep learning; food recipes; mm-res dataset; multi-modal fusion","Large dataset; Commonsense reasoning; Encoder-decoder; Labeled datasets; Large-scale dataset; Non-trivial tasks; Performance Gain; Text instruction; Textual information; Cooking","Bossard, L., Guillaumin, M., Van Gool, L., Food-101-Mining discriminative components with random forests (2014) Proceedings of ECCV, 8694, pp. 446-461; Carvalho, M., Cadène, R., Picard, D., Soulier, L., Thome, N., Cord, M., Cross-modal retrieval in the cooking context: Learning semantic text-image embeddings (2018) Proceedings of SIGIR., pp. 35-44; Carvalho, M., Cadène, R., Picard, D., Soulier, L., Thome, N., Cord, M., Cross-modal retrieval in the cooking context: Learning semantic text-image embeddings (2018) Proceedings of SIGIR., pp. 35-44; Chen, J., Pan, L., Wei, Z., Wang, X., Ngo, C.-W., Chua, T.-S., Zero-shot ingredient recognition by multi-relational graph convolutional network (2020) Proceedings of AAAI., pp. 10542-10550; Chen, J.-J., Ngo, C.-W., Chua, T.-S., Cross-modal recipe retrieval with rich food attributes (2017) Proceedings of ACM-MM., pp. 1771-1779; Chen, J.-J., Pan, L., Wei, Z., Wang, X., Ngo, C.-W., Chua, T.-S., Zero-shot ingredient recognition by multi-relational graph convolutional network (2017) Proceedings of AAAI.; Chung, J., Ahn, S., Bengio, Y., Hierarchical multiscale recurrent neural networks (2017) Proceedings of ICLR.; Devlin, J., Chang, M.-W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding (2019) Proceedings of NAACL-HLT., pp. 4171-4186; Gordon, J., Zhu, L., Galstyan, A., Natarajan, P., Burns, G., Modeling concept dependencies in a scientific corpus (2016) Proceedings of ACL, 1, pp. 866-875; Hamada, R., Okabe, J., Ide, I., Satoh, S., Sakai, S., Tanaka, H., Cooking navi: Assistant for daily cooking in kitchen (2005) Proceedings of ACM-MM., pp. 371-374; Harashima, J., Someya, Y., Kikuta, Y., Cookpad image dataset: An image collection as infrastructure for food research (2017) Proceedings of SIGIR., pp. 1229-1232; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Deep residual learning for image recognition (2016) Proceedings of CVPR., pp. 770-778; Herranz, L., Jiang, S., Xu, R., Modeling restaurant context for food recognition (2017) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM), 19 (2), pp. 430-440. , 2017; Hochreiter, S., Schmidhuber, J., Long short-term memory (1997) Neural Computation, 9 (8), pp. 1735-1780. , 1997; Horiguchi, S., Amano, S., Ogawa, M., Aizawa, K., Personalized classifier for food image recognition (2018) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM), 20 (10), pp. 2836-2848. , 2018; Jermsurawong, J., Habash, N., Predicting the structure of cooking recipes (2015) Proceedings of EMNLP., pp. 781-786; Karikome, S., Fujii, A., Improving structural analysis of cooking recipe text (2012) IEICE Technical Report.

It evaluates the potential of deep learning and state-of-the-art NLP tools in automated essay scoring (AES) to predict not only holistic scores but also the finer-grained rubric scores, an area underexplored but essential to provision formative feedback and uncover the AI reasoning behind AES. For comparison purpose, this paper advocates the need for transparency when sharing AES processes and outcomes. Finally, it reveals the insufficiency of ASAP essay datasets to train generalizable AES models by examining the distributions of holistic and rubric scores. Findings show that the strength of agreement between human and machine graders on holistic scores does not translate into similar strength on rubric scores and that the learning made by the machine barely exceeds the performance of a naïve predictor. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

Cramming education will no longer exist, and students have to learn more than memorizing. Secondly, artificial intelligence can provide a variety of effective learning methods, not only students can record learning content, but also make learning more effective. Teachers can also analyze the students’ learning and get feedback from the students so that they can learn from each other. STEAM education is increasingly valued by many countries, such as the ITEEA’s Education by Design, 6E Learning by DeSIGN STEM courses, and NASA-sponsored robot STEAM courses. South Korea have further promoted STEAM education (such as Incheon University) to propose the Wheel Model (STEAM & HUG). STEAM’s goals combining with design thinking, cross-domain learning, and teamwork form the main spirits of Taiwan’s 12-year national curriculum, which are “taking the initiative, engaging the public, and seeking the common good”. Those main components of artificial intelligence are knowledge reasoning, planning, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Artificial intelligence becomes an important learning and educational tool for students. Meanwhile, students learn through artificial intelligence products. Based on artificial intelligence components and STEAM education, how to develop instruction model and learning modules will be a most important theme. Through effectiveness artificial intelligence STEAM instruction, students’ higher-order thinking ability, creativity, problem solving ability, and the literacy of artificial intelligence will be improved effectively. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.","Artificial intelligence; STEAM; Teaching effectiveness","Computer vision; Curricula; Education computing; Educational robots; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine design; NASA; Natural language processing systems; Problem solving; Robot programming; Steam; Cross-domain learning; Educational tools; Effective learning; Higher-order thinkings; Knowledge reasoning; Learning contents; NAtural language processing; Problem-solving abilities; Students","(2019) Taiwan AI Action Plan-Mastering the opportunity to fully launch the industry’s AI, , https://www.ey.gov.tw/Page/5A8A0CB5B41DA11E/a8ec407c-6154-4c14-8f1e-d494ec2dbf23, Executive Yuan News and Communications Office; (2017) Using artificial intelligence education to enhance students’ competitiveness and creativity, , https://www.ey.gov.tw/Page/9277F759E41CCD91/70882f5c-5b3f-4a4e-8ff5-5ec1148ef830, Executive Yuan News and Communications Office; Helmstaedter, M., The mutual inspirations of machine learning and neuroscience (2015) Neuron, 86 (1), pp. 25-28; Kim, P.W., The wheel model of STEAM education based on traditional Korean scientific contents (2016) Eurasia J.

Hence, it has become essential to structure an efficient algorithm for analysing sentiments from text. Even though traditional machine learning algorithms were a breakthrough in the domain, there remained a demand for a better solution. This paper presents a systematic & qualitative literature review for various approaches to sentiment analysis using hybridized soft-computing techniques to cater to noise and improve the flexibility of a fuzzy inference-based sentiment analysis system. This qualitative literature review adds to the body of evidence that soft-computing and fuzzy logic techniques can be effectively applied to a range of applications where noise is inherent, especially in the case of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. © 2021 IEEE","Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Fuzzy logic; Genetic algorithms; Sentiment analysis","Cloud computing; Data mining; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Soft computing; Analysis techniques; Fuzzy logic techniques; Literature reviews; Opinion mining; Soft computing approaches; Softcomputing techniques; Sentiment analysis","Liu, B., (2012) Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining, , Morgan &Claypool; Wollmer, M., Weninger, F., Knaup, T., Schuller, B., Congkai, S., Sagae, K., Morency, L., Youtube movie reviews: Sentiment analysis in an audio-visual context (2013) IEEE Intell.

Those are achievement results in the world. At the same time, it is used in various applications and research fields. This technology is expected for using embedded systems of IoT devices such as smartphones and tablet-pc. This technology is expected for using the embedded system of IoT devices such as smartphones and tablet-pc. Deep-learning requires large computational resources and high power consumption. GPU is a kind of solution to computational resources. In general, most systems need to use GPU acceleration. However, it is a hard point to implement on tiny embedded devices under the required GPU. Also, in recent years, FPGAs have been applied to image processing technology fields such as defect inspection of automobiles, security systems, and industrial products. Hardware acceleration is one of the techniques to improve processing speed. This technique is often used in the field of image processing. Our research tried to design the hardware acceleration approach for the convolutional neural network and we compared the software processing approach and our hardware approach. The software processing approach is conventional. As a result, our hardware-based convolutional layer can show high-speed performance than the software-based design. These hardware-based modules were implemented on FPGA. We used HDL(Hardware Description Language) to implement on FPGA. By using this, you can create a logic circuit like programming. It is usually used when designing the FPGA circuit. In this paper, we show the detail of the architecture and the comparison result of processing time with CPU. © 2020 IEEE.","Convolutional Neural Network; FPGA; Pipeline","Computation theory; Computer circuits;

As an effect, in line with recent advances in machine learning research, software maintenance activities are switching from symbolic formal methods to data-driven methods. In this context, the rich semantics hidden in source code identifiers provide opportunities for building semantic representations of code which can assist tasks of code search and reuse. To this end, we deliver in the form of pretrained vector space models, distributed code representations for six popular programming languages, namely, Java, Python, PHP, C, C++, and C#. The models are produced using fastText, a state-of-the-art library for learning word representations. Each model is trained on data from a single programming language; the code mined for producing all models amounts to over 13.000 repositories. We indicate dissimilarities between natural language and source code, as well as variations in coding conventions in between the different programming languages we processed. We describe how these heterogeneities guided the data preprocessing decisions we took and the selection of the training parameters in the released models. Finally, we propose potential applications of the models and discuss limitations of the models. © 2019 IEEE.","Code Semantics; Fasttext; Semantic Similarity; Vector Space Models","Codes (symbols); Formal methods; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Object oriented programming; Open source software; Open systems; Semantics; Software design; Vector spaces; Code semantics; Distributed code representations; Fasttext; Machine learning research; Open source repositories; Semantic similarity; Software maintenance activity; Vector space models; C++ (programming language)","Allamanis, M., Barr, E.T., Devanbu, P., Sutton, C., A survey of machine learning for big code and naturalness (2018) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 51 (4), p. 81; Hindle, A., Barr, E.T., Su, Z., Gabel, M., Devanbu, P., On the naturalness of software (2012) Software Engineering (ICSE), 2012 34th International Conference on, , IEEE; Ernst, M.D., Natural language is a programming language: Applying natural language processing to software development (2017) LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics, 71. , Schloss Dagstuhl-Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik; White, M., Tufano, M., Vendome, C., Poshyvanyk, D., Deep learning code fragments for code clone detection (2016) Proceedings of the 31st IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, , ACM; Wei, H., Li, M., Supervised deep features for software functional clone detection by exploiting lexical and syntactical information in source code (2017) IJCAI; Vasilescu, B., Casalnuovo, C., Devanbu, P., Recovering clear, natural identifiers from obfuscated js names (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 11th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering, pp. 683-693. , ACM; Nguyen, A.T., Nguyen, T.T., Nguyen, T.N., Lexical statistical machine translation for language migration (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 9th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering, , ACM; Iyer, S., Konstas, I., Cheung, A., Zettlemoyer, L., Summarizing source code using a neural attention model (2016) Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1, pp. 2073-2083; Allamanis, M., Peng, H., Sutton, C., A convolutional attention network for extreme summarization of source code (2016) International Conference on Machine Learning; Pu, Y., Narasimhan, K., Solar-Lezama, A., Barzilay, R., Sk p: A neural program corrector for moocs (2016) Companion Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity, , ACM; Gupta, R., Pal, S., Kanade, A., Shevade, S., Deepfix: Fixing common c language errors by deep learning (2017) AAAI; Foster, S.R., Griswold, W.G., Lerner, S., Witchdoctor: Ide support for real-time auto-completion of refactorings (2012) Software Engineering (ICSE), 2012 34th International Conference on, , IEEE; Oda, Y., Fudaba, H., Neubig, G., Hata, H., Sakti, S., Toda, T., Nakamura, S., Learning to generate pseudo-code from source code using statistical machine translation (t) (2015) Automated Software Engineering (ASE), 2015 30th IEEE/ACM International Conference on, , IEEE; Ling, W., Blunsom, P., Grefenstette, E., Hermann, K.M., Kocisky, T., Wang, F., Senior, A., Latent predictor networks for code generation (2016) Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1; Yin, P., Neubig, G., A syntactic neural model for general-purpose code generation (2017) Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1; Alexandru, C.V., Panichella, S., Gall, H.C., Replicating parser behavior using neural machine translation (2017) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Program Comprehension, , IEEE Press; Allamanis, M., Sutton, C., Mining source code repositories at massive scale using language modeling (2013) Proceedings of the 10th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories, , IEEE Press; Palomba, F., Panichella, A., De Lucia, A., Oliveto, R., Zaidman, A., A textual-based technique for Smell Detection (2016) 2016 IEEE 24th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC), , Universita di Salerno, Salerno, Italy.

Originally mainly for computer scientists and engineers, it has been expanding its horizons and empowering many other disciplines contributing to the development of many novel applications in many sectors. These include medicine and health care, business and finance, psychology and neuroscience, physics and biology to mention a few. However, one of the disciplines in which artificial intelligence has not been fully explored and exploited yet is education. In this discipline, many research methods are employed by scholars, lecturers and practitioners to investigate the impact of different instructional approaches on learning and to understand the ways skills and knowledge are acquired by learners. One of these is qualitative research, a scientific method grounded in observations that manipulates and analyses non-numerical data. It focuses on seeking answers to why and how a particular observed phenomenon occurs rather than on its occurrences. This study aims to explore and discuss the impact of artificial intelligence on qualitative research methods. In particular, it focuses on how artificial intelligence have empowered qualitative research methods so far, and how it can be used in education for enhancing teaching and learning. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Automated reasoning; Behaviourism; Cognitivism; Constructivism; Data analysis; Education; Knowledge representation; Learning; Machine learning; Methods; Natural language processing; Perception; Planning; Qualitative research; Teaching","Artificial intelligence; Data reduction; Education; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Numerical methods; Planning; Sensory perception; Teaching; Automated reasoning; Behaviourism; Cognitivism; Constructivism; Learning; Methods; NAtural language processing; Qualitative research; Learning systems","Arora, S., Ge, R., Halpern, Y., Mimno, D., Moitra, A., Sontag, D., Wu, Y., Zhu, M., A practical algorithm for topic modeling with provable guarantees (2013) International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 280-288. , pp; Auerbach, C., Silverstein, L.B., (2003) Qualitative Data: An Introduction to Coding and Analysis, , NYU Press, New York; Bahrammirzaee, A., A comparative survey of artificial intelligence applications in finance: artificial neural networks, expert system and hybrid intelligent systems (2010) Neural Comput.

In order to understand the association between these factors towards building a risk map that can alert drivers of dangerous zones, the visual patterns reasoning system is proposed. By converting sensing data collected from different factors to raster images, the associations can be treated as visual patterns that can conserve their spatiotemporal information. Deep convolutional neural networks (Deep-CNN) are utilized to build a model based on these raster images towards detecting accidents based on the association between factors. Image clustering is applied to learn a representation of each type of associations. Thus, the visual pattern of high-probability traffic accidents can be reasoned in the natural language format. Both 2D and 3D raster images are investigated to examine the spatial and spatiotemporal associations between factors with Deep-CNN models. We use both transfer learning and fine-tuning approach to build our model due to the small size of the positive samples dataset. The evaluation shows the initial but promising results of our method. We also discuss the potential applications and various research directions can be investigated using our proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.","big urban sensing data; deep learning; knowledge discovery; pattern reasoning; raster image","Accidents; Big data; Data mining; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Maps; Neural networks; Visual languages; Convolutional neural network; Environmental data; Natural languages; pattern reasoning; Raster image; Spatiotemporal information; Transfer learning; Urban sensing; Rasterization","Chang, G.L., Xiang, H., The relationship between congestion levels and accidents (2003) State Highway Administration Research Report; Gao, J.H., Chen, X.J., Woodward, A., Liu, X.B., Wu, H.X., Lu, Y.G., Li, L.P., Liu, Q.Y., The association between meteorological factors and road traffic injuries: A case analysis from Shantou city, China (2016) Scientific Reports, 6, pp. 1-10. , 37300; Dailey, D.J., (2006) The Use of Weather Data to Predict Non-recurring Traffic Congestion, , Technical Report, University of Washington; Richard, R., Ray, S., A tale of two cities: Analyzing road accidents with big spatial data (2017) 2017 IEEE Int.

Explainable artificial intelligence is gaining considerable attention among researchers and developers to address this requirement. Although there is an increasing number of works on interpretable and transparent machine learning algorithms, they are mostly intended for the technical users. Explanations for the end-user have been neglected in many usable and practical applications. In this work, we present the Contextual Importance (CI) and Contextual Utility (CU) concepts to extract explanations that are easily understandable by experts as well as novice users. This method explains the prediction results without transforming the model into an interpretable one. We present an example of providing explanations for linear and non-linear models to demonstrate the generalizability of the method. CI and CU are numerical values that can be represented to the user in visuals and natural language form to justify actions and explain reasoning for individual instances, situations, and contexts. We show the utility of explanations in car selection example and Iris flower classification by presenting complete (i.e. the causes of an individual prediction) and contrastive explanation (i.e. contrasting instance against the instance of interest). The experimental results show the feasibility and validity of the provided explanation methods. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Black-box models; Contextual importance; Contextual utility; Contrastive explanations; Explainable AI","Autonomous agents; Forecasting; Intelligent agents; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Visual languages; Autonomous systems; Black-box model; Contextual importance; Contextual utility; Contrastive explanations; Individual prediction; Natural languages; Non-linear model; Multi agent systems","Biran, O., Cotton, C., Explanation and justification in machine learning: A survey (2017) IJCAI 17 Workshop on Explainable AI (XAI; Anjomshoae, S., Najjar, A., Calvaresi, D., Främling, K., Explainable agents and robots: Results from a systematic literature review (2019) Proceedings of the 18Th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems; Samek, W., Wiegand, T., Müller, K.R., (2017) Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Understanding, Visualizing and Interpreting Deep Learning Models, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Ras, G., van Gerven, M., Haselager, P., Explanation methods in deep learning: Users, values, concerns and challenges (2018) Explainable and Interpretable Models in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

A popular benchmark for evaluating models for visual reasoning is Visual Question Answering (VQA), which aims at answering questions about a given input image by joining the two modalities: (1) the text representing the question, as well as, (2) the visual information extracted from the input image. In this work, we propose a structured approach for VQA that is based on dynamic graphs learned automatically from the input. Unlike the common approach for VQA that relies on an attention mechanism applied on a cell-structured global embedding of the image, our model leverages the rich structure in the image depicted in the object instances and their interaction. In our model, nodes in the graph correspond to object instances present in the image while the edges represent relations among them. Our model automatically constructs the scene graph and attends to the relations among the nodes to answer the given question. Hence, our model can be trained end-to-end and it does not require additional training labels in the form of predefined graphs or relations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging open-ended Visual Genome [14] benchmark for VQA. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,"Deep learning; Pattern recognition; Attention mechanisms; Dynamic scenes; Evaluating models; Question Answering; Rich structure; Structured approach; Visual information; Visual reasoning; Graph theory","Agrawal, A., VQA: Visual question answering (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 2425-2433. , pp; Anderson, P., Bottom-up and top-down attention for image captioning and visual question answering (2018) CVPR; Andreas, J., Rohrbach, M., Darrell, T., Klein, D., Neural module networks (2016) CVPR; Bouchard, G., Singh, S., Trouillon, T., (2015) On Approximate Reasoning Capabilities of Low-Rank Vector Spaces, , AAAI; Conneau, A., Kiela, D., Schwenk, H., Barrault, L., Bordes, A., Supervised learning of universal sentence representations from natural language inference data (2017) EMNLP; Harzig, P., Eggert, C., Lienhart, R., Visual question answering with a hybrid convolution recurrent model (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval, pp. 318-325. , pp., ACM; Deng, Z., Vahdat, A., Hu, H., Mori, G., Structure inference machines: Recurrent neural networks for analyzing relations in group activity recognition (2016) CVPR; Hu, R., Andreas, J., Rohrbach, M., Darrell, T., Saenko, K., Learning to reason: End-to-end module networks for visual question answering (2017) ICCV; Johnson, J., Hariharan, B., van der Maaten, L., Fei-Fei, L., Zitnick, C.L., Girshick, R., CLEVR: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning (2017) CVPR; Johnson, J., (2015) Image Retrieval Using Scene Graphs, , CVPR; Kembhavi, A., Salvato, M., Kolve, E., Seo, M., Hajishirzi, H., Farhadi, A., A diagram is worth a dozen images (2016) ECCV 2016.

OSNs generate a huge massive volume of unstructured data making it difficult for the LEAs to ‘patrol the facts’ and to gather intelligence in order to provide it to the legal domain. There is no ontology model, among those found in literature, that allows to exhaustively describe all the aspects of crime investigation targeting data integration, information sharing, collection and preservation of digital evidences by using biometric features, and query answering. To bridge this gap, this paper presents an extended version of our earlier SMONT ontology, called CISMO as a semantic tool suitable for gathering digital evidence from OSNs helping LEAs to develop new investigative systems to counter the threat of different crimes. The new version introduces the core concepts related to crime cases in the police repositories, biometric data and digital evidences collected by OSNs, making it possible for LEAs to classify crimes, investigate hidden crime patterns or predict future crime patterns. CISMO is more concise and has a richer concept knowledge-based compared with the previous version SMONT. We prove the effectiveness of CISMO in a case study covering some general aspects in criminal cases in OSNs, demonstrating how this semantic approach can help LEAs to gather knowledge for crime investigation using natural language processing and machine learning to process messages shared in an online platform and also applying reasoning rules, as semantic inferences. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Biometrics; Crime; Digital evidence; Online social networks; Ontology; Reasoning; Security","Biometrics; Crime; Data integration; Knowledge based systems; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Social networking (online); Biometric features; Crime investigation; Criminal activities; Information sharing; Legal enforcement; NAtural language processing; Online social networks (OSNs); Semantic inference; Computer crime","Yaqoob, I., Hashem, I.A.T., Gani, A., Mokhtar, S., Ahmed, E., Anuar, N.B., Vasilakos, A.V., Big data: From beginning to future (2016) Int.

In contrast, humans can generally justify, in natural language, for their answer to a visual question with simple common sense reasoning. However, human introspection abilities have their own limits as one often struggles to justify for the recognition process behind our lowest level feature recognition ability: for instance, it is difficult to precisely explain why a given texture seems more characteristic of the surface of a finger nail rather than a plastic bottle. In this paper, we showcase an application in which deep learning models can actually help human experts justify for their own low-level visual recognition process: We study the problem of assessing the adhesive potency of copper sheets from microscopic pictures of their surface. Although highly trained material experts are able to qualitatively assess the surface adhesive potency, they are often unable to precisely justify for their decision process. We present a model that, under careful design considerations, is able to provide visual clues for human experts to understand and justify for their own recognition process. Not only can our model assist human experts in their interpretation of the surface characteristics, we show how this model can be used to test different hypothesis of the copper surface response to different manufacturing processes. © 2019 IEEE.","Interpretability; Texture-analysis; Weakly-supervised-segmentation","Adhesives; Bottles; Computer vision; Copper; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Plastic bottles; Textures; Commonsense reasoning; Design considerations; Internal representation; Interpretability; Manufacturing process; Supervised segmentation; Surface characteristics; Texture analysis; Visual languages","Antol, S., Agrawal, A., Lu, J., Mitchell, M., Batra, D., Lawrence Zitnick, C., Parikh, D., Vqa: Visual question answering (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 2425-2433; Arandjelovic, R., Gronat, P., Torii, A., Pajdla, T., Sivic, J., Netvlad: Cnn architecture for weakly supervised place recognition (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5297-5307; Bilen, H., Pedersoli, M., Tuytelaars, T., Weakly supervised object detection with posterior regularization (2014) British Machine Vision Conference, 3; Bilen, H., Pedersoli, M., Tuytelaars, T., Weakly supervised object detection with convex clustering (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1081-1089; Bilen, H., Vedaldi, A., Weakly supervised deep detection networks (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2846-2854; Carter, S., Armstrong, Z., Schubert, L., Johnson, I., Olah, C., Activation atlas (2019) Distill, 4 (3), p. e15; Chen, H., Engkvist, O., Wang, Y., Olivecrona, M., Blaschke, T., The rise of deep learning in drug discovery (2018) Drug Discovery Today, 23 (6), pp. 1241-1250; Evans, R., Jumper, J., Kirkpatrick, J., Sifre, L., Green, T., Qin, C., Zidek, A., Penedones, H., De novo structure prediction with deeplearning based scoring (2018) Annu Rev Biochem, 77, pp. 363-382; Gawehn, E., Hiss, J.A., Schneider, G., Deep learning in drug discovery (2016) Molecular Informatics, 35 (1), pp. 3-14; Girshick, R., Fast r-cnn (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 1440-1448; Girshick, R., Donahue, J., Darrell, T., Malik, J., Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation (2014) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 580-587; Goh, G.B., Hodas, N.O., Vishnu, A., Deep learning for computational chemistry (2017) Journal of Computational Chemistry, 38 (16), pp. 1291-1307; Goyal, Y., Khot, T., Summers-Stay, D., Batra, D., Parikh, D., Making the v in vqa matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in visual question answering (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 6904-6913; Hansen, K., Biegler, F., Ramakrishnan, R., Pronobis, W., Von Lilienfeld, O.A., Muller, K.-R., Tkatchenko, A., Machine learning predictions of molecular properties: Accurate many-body potentials and nonlocality in chemical space (2015) The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, 6 (12), pp. 2326-2331; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Spatial pyramid pooling in deep convolutional networks for visual recognition (2015) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 37 (9), pp. 1904-1916; Ke, R., Bugeau, A., Papadakis, N., Schuetz, P., Schönlieb, C.-B., (2019) A Multi-task U-net for Segmentation with Lazy Labels; Lee, K., Zung, J., Li, P., Jain, V., Seung, H.S., (2017) Superhuman Accuracy on the snemi3d Connectomics Challenge; Li, W., Field, K.G., Morgan, D., Automated defect analysis in electron microscopic images (2018) Npj Computational Materials, 4 (1), p. 36; Li, W., Yuan, Z., Fang, X., Wang, C., Knowing where to look?

However, many real-world problems like environment pollution forecasting apply RNNs on sequences of multi-dimensional data where each dimension represents an individual feature with semantic meaning such as PM2.5 and SO2. RNN interpretation on multi-dimensional sequences is challenging as users need to analyze what features are important at different time steps to better understand model behavior and gain trust in prediction. This requires effective and scalable visualization methods to reveal the complex many-to-many relations between hidden units and features. In this work, we propose a visual analytics system to interpret RNNs on multi-dimensional time-series forecasts. Specifically, to provide an overview to reveal the model mechanism, we propose a technique to estimate the hidden unit response by measuring how different feature selections affect the hidden unit output distribution. We then cluster the hidden units and features based on the response embedding vectors. Finally, we propose a visual analytics system which allows users to visually explore the model behavior from the global and individual levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with case studies using air pollutant forecast applications. © 2020 IEEE.","air pollutant forecast; interpretable machine learning; multi-dimensional time series; recurrent neural networks","Forecasting; Natural language processing systems; Pollution; Semantics; Time series; Visual languages; Visualization; Environment pollution; Multidimensional data; NAtural language processing; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Scalable visualization; Time series forecasts; Visual analytics systems; Visual interpretation; Recurrent neural networks","Sulfur Dioxide (so2) Pollution, , https://www.epa.gov/so2-pollution/sulfur-dioxide-basics#effects, Accessed: 2019-09-07; Andrews, R., Diederich, J., Tickle, A.B., Survey and critique of techniques for extracting rules from trained artificial neural networks (1995) Knowledge-based Systems, 8 (6), pp. 373-389; Brownlee, J., (2017) Long Short-term Memory Networks with Python: Develop Sequence Prediction Models with Deep Learning, , Machine Learning Mastery; Cao, J., Lee, S., Ho, K., Zhang, X., Zou, S., Fung, K., Chow, J.C., Watson, J.G., Characteristics of carbonaceous aerosol in pearl river delta region, China during 2001 winter period (2003) Atmospheric Environment, 37 (11), pp. 1451-1460; Chen, Y., Cheng, Q., Cheng, Y., Yang, H., Yu, H., Applications of recurrent neural networks in environmental factor forecasting: A review (2018) Neural Computation, 30 (11), pp. 2855-2881; Cho, K., Van Merrienboer, B., Gulcehre, C., Bahdanau, D., Bougares, F., Schwenk, H., Bengio, Y., (2014) Learning Phrase Representations Using Rnn Encoder-decoder for Statistical Machine Translation; Craven, M., Shavlik, J.W., Extracting tree-structured representations of trained networks (1996) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 24-30; Dhillon, I.S., Co-clustering documents and words using bipartite spectral graph partitioning (2001) Proceedings of the Seventh ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 269-274. , ACM; Friedman, J.H., Greedy function approximation: A gradient boosting machine (2001) Annals of Statistics, pp. 1189-1232; Gers, F.A., Eck, D., Schmidhuber, J., Applying lstm to time series predictable through time-window approaches (2002) Neural Nets WIRN Vietri-01, pp. 193-200. , Springer; Hochreiter, S., Untersuchungen zu dynamischen neuronalen netzen (1991) Diploma, Technische Universitat Munchen, 91 (1); Hochreiter, S., Schmidhuber, J., Long short-term memory (1997) Neural Computation, 9 (8), pp. 1735-1780; Karpathy, A., Johnson, J., Fei-Fei, L., (2015) Visualizing and Understanding Recurrent Networks; Kwon, B.C., Choi, M.-J., Kim, J.T., Choi, E., Kim, Y.B., Kwon, S., Sun, J., Choo, J., Retainvis: Visual analytics with interpretable and interactive recurrent neural networks on electronic medical records (2019) IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 25 (1), pp. 299-309; Li, J., Chen, X., Hovy, E., Jurafsky, D., (2015) Visualizing and Understanding Neural Models in Nlp; Lipton, Z.C., (2017) The Doctor Just Won't Accept That; Liu, M., Shi, J., Li, Z., Li, C., Zhu, J., Liu, S., Towards better analysis of deep convolutional neural networks (2017) IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 23 (1), pp. 91-100; Louie, P.K., Watson, J.G., Chow, J.C., Chen, A., Sin, D.W., Lau, A.K., Seasonal characteristics and regional transport of pm2 (2005) 5 in Hong Kong.

Although in recent years we have witnessed increasingly popular use of deep neural networks for sequence modeling, it is still challenging to explain the rationales behind the model outputs, which is essential for building trust and supporting the domain experts to validate, critique and refine the model. We propose ProSeNet, an interpretable and steerable deep sequence model with natural explanations derived from case-based reasoning. The prediction is obtained by comparing the inputs to a few prototypes, which are exemplar cases in the problem domain. For better interpretability, we define several criteria for constructing the prototypes, including simplicity, diversity, and sparsity and propose the learning objective and the optimization procedure. ProSeNet also provides a user-friendly approach to model steering: domain experts without any knowledge on the underlying model or parameters can easily incorporate their intuition and experience by manually refining the prototypes. We conduct experiments on a wide range of real-world applications, including predictive diagnostics for automobiles, ECG, and protein sequence classification and sentiment analysis on texts. The result shows that ProSeNet can achieve accuracy on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models. We also evaluate the interpretability of the results with concrete case studies. Finally, through user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we demonstrate that the model selects high-quality prototypes which align well with human knowledge and can be interactively refined for better interpretability without loss of performance. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

But, with the increase in the number of states, lot of rules are required to be added, with additional logic, and hence create a delicate code which is difficult to keep up and maintain. In this work, we have shown how the stateless approach of building a chatbot using Rasa Core eliminated the need of complex state machine approach, as it makes use of machine learning-based dialog management. Along with this, we trained the model separately with the two pipelines “spacy” and “Tensorflow embedding”. We evaluated the two pipelines with cross-validation and without cross-validation for intent classification. The result showed that, with more training examples, Tensorflow embedding shows good accuracy for intent classification. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Natural language understanding; Spacy; Tensorflow embedding","Computer circuits; Embeddings; Pipelines; Additional logic; Chatbot; Chatbots; Cross validation; Dialog management; Number of state; State machine approaches; Training example; Artificial intelligence","Bocklisch, T, Faulker, J, Pawlowski, N, Nichol, A, (2017) Rasa: open source language understanding and dialogue management, , ArXiv Prepr.

It has been one of the most researched areas in machine learning with various applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, language detection and spam filter etc. The efficiency of text classification improves, when some relation or pattern in the data is given or known, which can be provided by ontology. It further helps in reducing the size of dataset. Ontology is a collection of data items that helps in storing and representing data in a way that preserves the patterns in it and its semantic relationship with each other. We have attempted to verify the improvement provided by the use of ontology in classification algorithms. The code prepared in this research and the method developed is pretty generic, and could be extended to any ontology based text classification system. In this paper, we present an enhanced architecture that can uses ontology to provide an effective text classification mechanism. We have introduced an ontology based text classification algorithm by utilizing the rich semantic information in Disease ontology (DOID). We summarize the existing work and finally advocate that the ontology based text classification strategy is better as compared to conventional text classification in terms of different metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-measure etc. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

With the denotation, e.g., the membership function of class {Adult}, we can make new probability prediction, e.g., likelihood function, for changed P(x). However, existing methods including Likelihood Method and Bayesian Inference cannot resolve this problem. For this purpose, the author proposes and proves the third kind of Bayes&#x2019; Theorem, which includes two asymmetrical Bayes&#x2019; formulas. The membership function so obtained is equivalent to that from random set statistics proposed by Peizhuang Wang. When samples are very big so that there are continuous sampling distributions P(x, y), we can directly derive a group of membership functions by a new Bayes formula. If samples are not big enough, we can use the semantic information formula, a generalized Kullback-Leibler formula, to optimize the membership functions by sampling distributions. The semantic information criterion is compatible with maximum likelihood criterion and Regularized Least Squares (RLS) criterion. In comparison with the likelihood function and the Bayesian posterior, the membership function so obtained as the predictive model can be used with new source P(x) to produce new likelihood function for better generalization performance. New Bayes&#x2019; formulas and the semantic information method can be applied to machine learning. The paper simply introduces their applications to (1) multi-label classifications; (2) maximum mutual information classifications for unseen instances; and (3) mixture models. It is shown that new methods are very simple and reliable. It seems that the membership function so obtained can bridge the gap between logic and probability. With this membership function, we can develop a new mathematical tool: Logical Bayesian Inference. &#x00A9; 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Bayes&#x2019; theorem; Likelihood function; Logical probability; Machine learning; Membership function; Multi-label classification; Natural language processing; Semantic information","Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Cognitive systems; Inference engines; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Maximum likelihood; Natural language processing systems; Sampling; Semantics; Signal processing; Stereophonic broadcasting; Generalization performance; Likelihood functions; Maximum likelihood criteria; Maximum mutual information; Multi label classification; NAtural language processing; Regularized least squares; Semantic information; Membership functions","Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy sets (1965) Inf.

With the denotation, e.g., the membership function of class {Adult}, we can make new probability prediction, e.g., likelihood function, for changed P(x). However, existing methods including Likelihood Method and Bayesian Inference cannot resolve this problem. For this purpose, the author proposes and proves the third kind of Bayes&#x2019; Theorem, which includes two asymmetrical Bayes&#x2019; formulas. The membership function so obtained is equivalent to that from random set statistics proposed by Peizhuang Wang. When samples are very big so that there are continuous sampling distributions P(x, y), we can directly derive a group of membership functions by a new Bayes formula. If samples are not big enough, we can use the semantic information formula, a generalized Kullback-Leibler formula, to optimize the membership functions by sampling distributions. The semantic information criterion is compatible with maximum likelihood criterion and Regularized Least Squares (RLS) criterion. In comparison with the likelihood function and the Bayesian posterior, the membership function so obtained as the predictive model can be used with new source P(x) to produce new likelihood function for better generalization performance. New Bayes&#x2019; formulas and the semantic information method can be applied to machine learning. The paper simply introduces their applications to (1) multi-label classifications; (2) maximum mutual information classifications for unseen instances; and (3) mixture models. It is shown that new methods are very simple and reliable. It seems that the membership function so obtained can bridge the gap between logic and probability. With this membership function, we can develop a new mathematical tool: Logical Bayesian Inference. &#x00A9; 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Bayes&#x2019; theorem; Likelihood function; Logical probability; Machine learning; Membership function; Multi-label classification; Natural language processing; Semantic information","Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Cognitive systems; Inference engines; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Maximum likelihood; Natural language processing systems; Sampling; Semantics; Signal processing; Stereophonic broadcasting; Generalization performance; Likelihood functions; Maximum likelihood criteria; Maximum mutual information; Multi label classification; NAtural language processing; Regularized least squares; Semantic information; Membership functions","Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy sets (1965) Inf.

In contrast to desktop, limited screen space of mobile carrying variety of ineffectual content magnifies the visual complexity of webpage by disrupting focus of user to read useful content. To solve this issue, Reader mode functionality renders a clutter-free version of web page by stripping out all insignificant elements and letting user to read the content they are actually interested in. Existing implementation in our browser involves 2 modules - Article Detection module that runs heuristics to detect whether a web page is article or not, proceeded by Article Extraction module that extracts the main content of the web page by removing all unwanted elements. Our paper focusses on improving the accuracy of article detection logic by proposing a machine-learning based solution that significantly surpasses the present heuristic-based model in terms of accuracy. In order to get rid of false positives on webpages with meaningless content like product descriptions, we extended our previous solution [1] by incorporating backward-elimination heuristics for web page title and extracting strong Boolean predictors. Our approach also solves the problem of detecting reader mode on Google's AMP HTML web pages where main-content is rendered in an iframe. With this model, we were able to achieve a precision of 0.99 and a recall of 0.94, which outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques which are being used by the major Android based web browsers in the market today. © 2021 IEEE.","Adaboost; AMP Pages; AutoML; DOM; Feature Engineering; Machine Learning; Normalization; On device AI; Outlier; PCA; Readability; ROC; Web Browser; Winsorization","Machine learning; Rendering (computer graphics); Turing machines; Web browsers; Backward elimination; Boolean predictors; Detection logic; Detection modules; Product descriptions; State-of-the-art techniques; Text-based features; Visual complexity; Websites","Nayak, P., Thadichi, B., Patidar, H., Article detection on the web using dom and text based features (2019) 2019 IEEE 16th India Council International Conference (INDICON), pp. 1-4. , Rajkot, India; Zhang, T., Learning structured representation for the text classification via reinforcement (2018) AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Mierzwik, B., Methods for web content analysis and context detection PSU CS Fall 2015 Capstone Group D for Mozilla Foundation; Kohlschütter, C., Boilerplate detection using shallow text features (2010) Proc.

While most approaches concentrate on modeling the structural information of the graph, part of the work also focuses on fusing entity descriptions, allowing entities to be fused with richer semantics. However, the complex entity text descriptions contain a lot of noise, which reduces the semantic purity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel sememes-based framework for knowledge graph to streamline the semantic space of entities. More specifically, We replace entity descriptions with a finite set of semantics and encode the sememe labels of entities using a pre-trained Bert model, and finally jointly learning the symbolic triples and sememe labels. The experimental results show that our method outperforms other baselines on the task of link prediction and entity classification. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Knowledge graph embedding; Link prediction; Sememes-based description","Embeddings; Knowledge representation; Semantics; Complex entities; Comprehensive information; Knowledge graphs; Link prediction; Low dimensional; Machine learning models; Semantic Space; Structural information; Learning systems","Bloomfield, L., A set of postulates for the science of language (1926) Language, 2 (3), pp. 153-164; Bollacker, K., Evans, C., Paritosh, P., Sturge, T., Taylor, J., Freebase: A collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1247-1250. , pp; Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Garcia-Duran, A., Weston, J., Yakhnenko, O., Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data (2013) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2787-2795. , pp; Devlin, J., Chang, M.W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., (2018) Bert: Pre-Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding.

In real-life communication, people are spontaneously modulating their tone to accentuate specific points or to express their sentiments. This research work introduces a supervised fuzzy rule-based system for multimodal sentiment classification, that can identify the sentiment expressed in video reviews on social media platform. It has been demonstrated that multimodal sentiment analysis can be effectively performed by the joint use of linguistic and acoustic modalities. In this paper computation of the sentiment using an ingenious set of fuzzy rules has been applied to label the review into: positive or negative sentiment. The confidence score from supervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification of text and speech cues is considered as the input variable for the fuzzy rules. The fusion of fuzzy logic with acoustic and linguistic features for classifying sentiment contributes a new exemplar in multimodal sentiment analysis. Our fuzzy approach has been compared with eight state-of-the-art techniques for supervised machine learning. The experiments on benchmark datasets yield 82.5 % accuracy for our approach which is higher in contrast to the state-of-the-art. © 2020 The Authors.

This approach has been used in order to avoid the overhead of extracting features from sentences manually. Integer linear programming (ILP) approach has been adopted for selecting sentences to generate the summary based on sentence ranks. This ILP model minimizes the redundancy in the generated summary.

Research on sexual harassment in social media has been gaining popularity of late, due to the genuine long-term effects such harassment can have on an individual like depression, withdrawal, loss of self-confidence, self-destructive tendencies, and propagation of a conducive environment for sexual assault. The approaches to tackle this issue using technology range from simple lexicon-based models to sophisticated machine learning models. Lexicon-based systems utilize dictionaries that contain offensive words that are characteristic of sexual harassment. Rule-based approaches need to be supplemented with logical reasoning in order to define rules which can be matched with the text to distinguish sexual harassment. Machine learning approaches develop predictive models that can detect sexually offensive messages. This paper holistically studies approaches used to solve the problem of classification of sexual harassment in cyberspace and aims to determine the best directions for future research in this field. It also studies the methods of analyzing the social network in terms of the structure of ties between users that can be used to study specific user patterns and characteristics. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Lexicon-based systems; Machine learning approaches; Rule-Based Systems; Sexual harassment; Social network analysis; Twitter",,"Peddinti, S.T., Ross, K.W., Cappos, J., On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog (2014) Proceedings of the Second Edition of the ACM Conference on Online Social Networks—COSN ’14; Xu, Z., Zhu, S., Filtering offensive language in online communities using grammatical relations (2010) Proceedings of the Seventh Annual Collaboration, Electronic Messaging, Anti-Abuse and Spam Conference (CEAS’10); Chen, Y., Zhou, Y., Zhu, S., Xu, H., Detecting offensive language in social media to protect adolescent online safety, in Proceedings of the 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Social Computing and 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Privacy Security Risk and Trust ser (2012) SOCIALCOM-PASSAT ’12, pp. 71-80. , pp; Bretschneider, U., Wöhner, T., Peters, R., (2014) Detecting Online Harassment in Social Networks, , http://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=icis2014; Chatzakou, D., Kourtellis, N., Blackburn, J., Cristofaro, E.D., Stringhini, G., Vakali, A., (2017) Mean Birds: Detecting Aggression and Bullying on Twitter; Khatua, A., Cambria, E., Khatua, A., Sounds of silence breakers: Exploring sexual violence on twitter (2018) 2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); Goenaga, I., Atutxa, A., Gojenola, K., Casillas, A., de Ilarraza, A.D., Ezeiza, N., Oronoz, M., de Vinaspre, O.P., Automatic misogyny identification using neural networks (2018) Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Evaluation of Human Language Technologies for Iberian Languages (Ibereval 2018), Co-Located with 34Th Conference of the Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing (SEPLN, p. 2018. , CEUR Workshop Proceedings.

However, research in AI has been hindered by biases and misconceptions that concern its possibilities and by the uncertainty and lack of clarity in respect to what does it mean for a machine to ‘learn’ or to ‘understand’. The aim of this paper is to discuss human and artificial understanding and to assess how state-of-the-art research fares in respect to the development of artificial systems capable of understanding. To do that, I first consider four notions that can help us in having a richer vision of what understanding amounts to: knowledge, grasp, problem-solving, and context sensitivity. In the central section of the paper, I identify two kinds of understanding that are necessary for creativity, a competence that current research in AI strives to reproduce in artificial systems. I then, discuss the impressive, but not completely satisfactory, achievements of Natural Language Processing, a branch of AI that is moving towards gaining a higher level of understanding. I close the paper by arguing how the current program of neurosymbolic AI is showing promising results in the progress toward achieving the desired level of understanding and creativity in machines. This program takes inspiration from the dual-model of the human mind proposed by Daniel Kahneman in his bestselling work Thinking Fast and Slow and it parallels the mechanisms that are necessary to develop not only a context-sensitive understanding, but also creative capabilities. © 2021 AISB Convention 2021: Communication and Conversations.

Many previous path-based methods like PRA and DeepPath suffer from lacking memory components, or stuck in training. Therefore, their performances always rely on well-pretraining. In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement learning based model named by AttnPath, which incorporates LSTM and Graph Attention Mechanism as the memory components. We define two metrics, Mean Selection Rate (MSR) and Mean Replacement Rate (MRR), to quantitatively measure how difficult it is to learn the query relations, and take advantages of them to fine-tune the model under the framework of reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, a novel mechanism of reinforcement learning is proposed by forcing an agent to walk forward every step to avoid the agent stalling at the same entity node constantly. Based on this operation, the proposed model not only can get rid of the pretraining process, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance comparing with the other models. We test our model on FB15K-237 and NELL-995 datasets with different tasks. Extensive experiments show that our model is effective and competitive with many current state-of-the-art methods, and also performs well in practice. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Knowledge representation; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; Reinforcement learning; Attention mechanisms; Knowledge graphs; Memory component; Pre-training; Replacement rates; State-of-the-art methods; State-of-the-art performance; Walk forward; Deep learning","Bollacker, K., Evans, C., Paritosh, P., Sturge, T., Taylor, J., FreeBase: A collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge (2008) SIGMOD, pp. 1247-1250; Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Garcia-Duran, A., Weston, J., Yakhnenko, O., Translating embeddings for modeling multirelational data (2013) NeurIPS, pp. 2787-2795; Carlson, A., Betteridge, J., Kisiel, B., Settles, B., Hruschka, E.R., Jr., Mitchell, T.M., Toward an architecture for never-ending language learning (2010) AAAI, 5, pp. 1306-1313; Chen, W., Xiong, W., Yan, X., Wang, W., Variational knowledge graph reasoning (2018) NAACL-HLT, pp. 1823-1832; Das, R., Dhuliawala, S., Zaheer, M., Vilnis, L., Durugkar, I., Krishnamurthy, A., Smola, A., McCallum, A., Go for a walk and arrive at the answer: Reasoning over paths in knowledge bases using reinforcement learning (2018) ICLR; Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., Riedel, S., Convolutional 2d knowledge graph embeddings (2018) AAAI, pp. 1811-1818; Dubey, M., Banerjee, D., Chaudhuri, D., Lehmann, J., Strong baselines for simple question answering over knowledge graphs with and without neural networks (2018) ISWC, pp. 108-126; Guu, K., Miller, J., Liang, P., Traversing knowledge graphs in vector space (2015) EMNLP, pp. 318-327; Ji, G., He, S., Xu, L., Liu, K., Zhao, J., Knowledge graph embedding via dynamic mapping matrix (2015) ACL, 1, pp. 687-696; Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., ADaM: A method for stochastic optimization (2015) ICLR; Lao, N., Mitchell, T., Cohen, W.W., Random walk inference and learning in a large scale knowledge base (2011) EMNLP, pp. 529-539; Lin, X.V., Socher, R., Xiong, C., Multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning with reward shaping (2018) EMNLP, pp. 3243-3253; Lin, Y., Liu, Z., Sun, M., Liu, Y., Zhu, X., Learning entity and relation embeddings for knowledge graph completion (2015) AAAI, 15, pp. 2181-2187; Liu, Z., Xiong, C., Sun, M., Liu, Z., Entity-duet neural ranking: Understanding the role of knowledge graph semantics in neural information retrieval (2018) ACL, pp. 2395-2405; Miller, G.A., WordNet: A lexical database for english (1995) Communications of the ACM, 38 (11), pp. 39-41; Neelakantan, A., Roth, B., McCallum, A., Compositional vector space models for knowledge base completion (2015) ACL, pp. 156-166; Shen, Y., Chen, J., Huang, P.-S., Guo, Y., Gao, J., M-walk: Learning to walk over graphs using monte carlo tree search (2018) NeurIPS, pp. 6787-6798; Toutanova, K., Chen, D., Pantel, P., Poon, H., Choudhury, P., Gamon, M., Representing text for joint embedding of text and knowledge bases (2015) EMNLP, pp. 1499-1509; Toutanova, K., Lin, V., Yih, W.-T., Poon, H., Quirk, C., Compositional learning of embeddings for relation paths in knowledge base and text (2016) ACL, 1, pp. 1434-1444; Velickovic, P., Cucurull, G., Casanova, A., Romero, A., Lio, P., Bengio, Y., Graph attention networks (2018) ICLR; Wang, W.Y., Cohen, W.W., Learning first-order logic embeddings via matrix factorization (2016) IJCAI, pp. 2132-2138; Wang, X., Wang, D., Xu, C., He, X., Cao, Y., Chua, T.-S., Explainable reasoning over knowledge graphs for recommendation (2019) AAAI; Wang, Z., Li, L., Zeng, D.D., Chen, Y., Attention-based multi-hop reasoning for knowledge graph (2018) ISI, pp. 211-213; Williams, R.J., Simple statistical gradient-following algorithms for connectionist reinforcement learning (1992) Machine Learning, 8 (3-4), pp. 229-256; Xiong, W., Hoang, T., Wang, W.Y., Deeppath: A reinforcement learning method for knowledge graph reasoning (2017) EMNLP, pp. 564-573; Yang, F., Yang, Z., Cohen, W.W., Differentiable learning of logical rules for knowledge base reasoning (2017) NeurIPS, pp. 2319-2328","Pan, R.; School of Data and Computer Science, China; email: panr@mail.sysu.edu.cn","Apple;ASAPP;et al.;Facebook;Google;salesforce","Association for Computational Linguistics","2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019","3 November 2019 through 7 November 2019",,159367,"EMNLP-IJCNLP - Conf.

The inference or optimization is performed over an assumed deterministic model with deep structure. A wide range of temporal and spatial data in language and vision are treated as the inputs or outputs to build such a domain mapping for multimedia applications. A systematic and elaborate transfer is required to meet the mapping between source and target domains. Also, the semantic structure in natural language and computer vision may not be well represented or trained in mathematical logic or computer programs. The distribution function in discrete or continuous latent variable model for words, sentences, images or videos may not be properly decomposed or estimated. The system robustness to heterogeneous environments may not be assured. This tutorial addresses the fundamentals and advances in statistical models and neural networks for domain mapping, and presents a series of deep Bayesian solutions including variational Bayes, sampling method, Bayesian neural network, variational auto-encoder (VAE), stochastic recurrent neural network, sequence-to-sequence model, attention mechanism, end-to-end network, stochastic temporal convolutional network, temporal difference VAE, normalizing flow and neural ordinary differential equation. Enhancing the prior/posterior representation is addressed in different latent variable models. We illustrate how these models are connected and why they work for a variety of applications on complex patterns in language and vision. The word, sentence and image embeddings are merged with semantic constraint or structural information. Bayesian learning is formulated in the optimization procedure where the posterior collapse is tackled. An informative latent space is trained to incorporate deep Bayesian learning in various information systems. © 2020 Owner/Author.","Bayesian learning; computer vision; deep learning; domain mapping; multimedia; natural language processing; sequential learning","Bayesian networks; Convolutional neural networks; Distribution functions; Learning systems; Mapping; Ordinary differential equations; Sampling; Semantics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Bayesian neural networks; Convolutional networks; Heterogeneous environments; Latent variable modeling; Latent variable models; Multimedia applications; Optimization procedures; Stochastic recurrent neural network; Recurrent neural networks","Aksan, E., Hilliges, O., STCN: Stochastic temporal convolutional networks (2019) Proc.

But they only focus on the direct relationship between entities and ignore the importance of the semantic features of entity types. In addition, a large amount of unstructured text can effectively supplement the semantic information of the Knowledge Graph (KG). In order to solve the problem of scattered knowledge and lack of relationships in the KG, we propose a neural network model which is based on attention mechanism.

We still have more books and writings than sound and image data. This predominance engages the need for engineers in the field of computer science to enhance the comprehension of text by machines, and the capacity to retrieve or create information out of text data. Semantics is the study of the relationship between the meaning of signs in a particular language. The understanding of the different meaning of textual elements present in a sentence gives us the capacity to interpret text and give it a logical meaning. We have to note that in the absence of a link between those different meanings, a complete sentence cannot be formed and no meaning can, therefore, be extracted. Our goal is to make possible for a machine to grasp those meanings along with the semantic relationships and establish a knowledge, and once this knowledge is established into semantic sequences, converting it into a visual representation such as an image could deeply improve our capacity of comprehension of text and help individuals having trouble understanding a text. To achieve this, we decided to first define a text parsing and summarization technique using word embeddings and engage into a text to image conversion using a GAN. The logic behind this implementation is to give the computer the ability to grasp semantic sequences and define sequences of illustrations based on the text provided. © 2020 Owner/Author.","Att-GAN; Conversion; DCGAN; Discriminator; Generator; Image; LSTM; Machine learning; Neural networks; Regression; Semantics parsing; Sequences; Text; Text mining","Image enhancement; Syntactics; Graphical representations; Image conversion; Image data; Information elements; Semantic relationships; Text data; Text parsing; Visual representations; Semantics","Bao, J.-P., Shen, J.-Y., Liu, X.-D., Liu, H.-Y., Zhang, X.-D., (2004) Semantic Sequence Kin: A Method of Document Copy Detection, , Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg; Jia, R., Liang, P., (2016) Data Recombination for Neural Semantic Parsing, , 11 Jun; Radford, A., Metz, L., Chintala, S., (2016) Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, , 7 Jan; Xu, T., Zhang, P., Huang, Q., Zhang, H., Gan, Z., Huang, X., He, X., (2017) AttnGAN: Fine-Grained Text to Image Generation with Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks, , 28 Nov",,"University of South Florida","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","2020 ACM Southeast Conference, ACMSE 2020","2 April 2020 through 4 April 2020",,160113,"ACMSE - Proc.

We have built a prototype, which 1) applies text classification and text mining methods on job vacancy announcements to match jobs and their required skills; 2) predicts the quality of videos; and 3) creates an open educational video recommender system to suggest personalized learning content to learners. For the first evaluation of this prototype we focused on the area of data science related jobs. Our prototype was evaluated by in-depth, semi-structured interviews. 15 subject matter experts provided feedback to assess how our recommender prototype performs in terms of its objectives, logic, and contribution to learning. More than 250 videos were recommended, and 82.8% of these recommendations were treated as useful by the interviewees. Moreover, interviews revealed that our personalized video recommender system, has the potential to improve the learning experience. © 2020 IEEE.","Educational recommender system; Lifelong learning; Machine learning; OER; Open educational resource; Text classification; Text mining; Video recommender system","Classification (of information); Data Science; Employment; Recommender systems; Text mining; Educational videos; Learning experiences; Personalized learning; Personalized video; Semi structured interviews; Skill requirements; Subject matter experts; Text classification; Learning systems","Colombo, E., Mercorio, F., Mezzanzanica, M., (2018) Applying Machine Learning Tools on Web Vacancies for Labour Market and Skill Analysis; Wowczko, I., Skills and vacancy analysis with data mining techniques (2015) Informatics, 2 (4), pp. 31-49. , Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute; McGill, M.M., Defining the expectation gap: A comparison of industry needs and existing game development curriculum (2009) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Foundations of Digital Games, pp. 129-136; Khobreh, M., Ansari, F., Fathi, M., Vas, R., Mol, S.T., Berkers, H.A., Varga, K., An ontology-based approach for the semantic representation of job knowledge (2015) Ieee Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, 4 (3), pp. 462-473; Djumalieva, J., Sleeman, C., An open and data-driven taxonomy of skills extracted from online job adverts (2018) Developing Skills in a Changing World of Work: Concepts, Measurement and Data Applied in Regional and Local Labour Market Monitoring across Europe, p. 425; Kanwar, A., Mishra, S., (2018) Global Trends in Oer: What Is the Future?; Ha, K.-H., Niemann, K., Schwertel, U., Holtkamp, P., Pirkkalainen, H., Boerner, D., Kalz, M., Pappa, D., A novel approach towards skill-based search and services of open educational resources (2011) Research Conference on Metadata and Semantic Research, pp. 312-323. , Springer; Sun, G., Cui, T., Xu, D., Shen, J., Chen, S., A heuristic approach for new-item cold start problem in recommendation of micro open education resources (2018) International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, pp. 212-222. , Springer; Ruiz-Iniesta, A., Jimenez-Diaz, G., Gomez-Albarran, M., A se-mantically enriched context-Aware oer recommendation strategy and its application to a computer science oer repository (2014) Ieee Transactions on Education, 57 (4), pp. 255-260; Chicaiza, J., Piedra, N., Lopez-Vargas, J., Tovar-Caro, E., A user profile definition in context of recommendation of open educational resources.

We demonstrate that GPT-3, a state-of-the-art contextual language model, captures persistent Muslim-violence bias. We probe GPT-3 in various ways, including prompt completion, analogical reasoning, and story generation, to understand this anti-Muslim bias, demonstrating that it appears consistently and creatively in different uses of the model and that it is severe even compared to biases about other religious groups. For instance, Muslim is analogized to terrorist in 23% of test cases, while Jewish is mapped to its most common stereotype, money, in 5% of test cases. We quantify the positive distraction needed to overcome this bias with adversarial text prompts, and find that use of the most positive 6 adjectives reduces violent completions for Muslims from 66% to 20%, but which is still higher than for other religious groups. © 2021 ACM.","bias; ethics; language models; machine learning; stereotypes","Computational linguistics; Philosophical aspects; Analogical reasoning; Language model; Religious groups; State of the art; Story generations; Test case; Artificial intelligence","Abid, A., Abdalla, A., Abid, A., Khan, D., Alfozan, A., Zou, J., (2019) Gradio: Hassle-free Sharing and Testing of Ml Models in the Wild., , 2019; Bolukbasi, T., Chang, K., Zou, J.Y., Saligrama, V., Kalai, A.T., Man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker?

Social media, where users share their personal experiences of medication effects, have been recommended as an alternative data source of gathering signal information of suspected medication effects. To discover potential medication-effect relations from Twitter data, we devised a method employing analogical reasoning with neural embedding of Twitter text. The process involves learning the neural embedding from unlabeled tweets and performing vector arithmetic, making it obscure to understand how an inferred relation is derived. To make the process understandable and interpretable and to facilitate the decision making on accepting or rejecting any inferred medication-effect relations, we added explanation(s) to each step of the process.

Embeddings are being used successfully for mapping relational data or text into vector spaces where they can be used for machine learning, similarity search, or similar tasks. We address the problem of finding vector space embeddings for theories in the Description Logic EL++that are also models of the TBox. To find such embeddings, we define an optimization problem that characterizes the model-theoretic semantics of the operators in EL++within Rn, thereby solving the problem of finding an interpretation function for an EL++theory given a particular domain ∆. Our approach is mainly relevant to large EL++theories and knowledge bases such as the ontologies and knowledge graphs used in the life sciences. We demonstrate that our method can be used for improved prediction of protein-protein interactions when compared to semantic similarity measures or knowledge graph embeddings. © 2019 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

The monthly active usage of major social media platform such as Facebook is 2.32 billion monthly active users (MAU) and of Twitter is 126 million; hence, the market for understanding the customer sentiment through social media can be a game changer for a company and can help define the success of the company in the future. If the sentiments of the users are not captured correctly, it could lead to catastrophic failure of the product and hamper company’s reputation. Existing systems require a lot of manual tasks such as customer surveys, aggregating the sentiments then generating excel reports which are not very interactive and require a lot of time to gather results. These reports also do not show real-time data. People express their opinion on social media. Companies can use such platforms to capture honest and transparent opinions of the consumers. The cognitive service evaluates tweet texts and returns a sentiment score for each text, ranging from 0 (negative) to 1 (positive). This capability is useful for detecting positive and negative sentiments in social media such as Facebook, Twitter, customer reviews, and discussion forums. The machine learning model used by the cognitive service helps determine sentiment using data provided by the user. This feedback can allow the company to know the acceptance of the product in prototype stages and can use the same to modify the product as per the customer feedback before making the product generally available. The implementation environment uses Azure services (Logic apps, Cognitive Services, SQL Database, App Services) with Power BI used to generate real-time business intelligent reports to capture customer sentiment, and a Windows 10 workstation can be used to access all these services. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Azure services; Business intelligent; Customer sentiments; Machine learning model",,"Jindal, N., Liu, B., (2008) Opinion Spam and Analysis, in Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference On, Web Search and Data Mining, WSDM ’08, pp. 219-230. , ACM, New York, ), pp; Mukherjee, A., Liu, B., Glance, N., (2012) Spotting Fake Reviewer Groups in Consumer Reviews, in Proceedings of the 21St, International Conference on World Wide Web, WWW ’12, pp. 191-200. , ACM, New York, ), pp; Pang, B., Lee, L., A sentimental education: Sentiment analysis using subjectivity summariza-tion based on minimum cuts Proceedings of the 42Nd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL ’04, p. 2004. , Association for Computational Linguistics, Stroudsburg; Turney, P.D., (2002) Thumbs up Or Thumbs Down?

The first project is related to teaching in the field of nuclear physics and nuclear power engineering. The second project is related to training in computer science and programming. The possibility of using the DLLearner software in conjunction with the Apache Jena Reasoners in order to refine the ontologies that are designed on the basis of the SROIQ(D) description logic is shown. A software agent for the context-sensitive searching for new knowledge in the WWW has been developed as a toolkit for ontologies enrichment. The binary Pareto relation and Levenshtein metrics are used in order to evaluate the measure of compliance of the found content concerning a specific domain. It allows the knowledge engineer to calculate the measure of the proximity of an arbitrary network resource about classes and objects of specific knowledge graphs. The suggested software solutions are based on cloud computing using DBaaS and PaaS service models to ensure the scalability of data warehouses and network services. Examples of applying the software and technologies under discuss are given. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

This paper describes two approaches to an important form of legal decision support-explainable outcome prediction-that obviate both annotation of an entire decision corpus and manual processing of new cases. The first approach, which uses an Attention Network for prediction and attention weights to highlight salient case text, was shown to be capable of predicting decisions, but attention-weight-based text highlighting did not demonstrably improve human decision speed or accuracy in an evaluation with 61 human subjects. The second approach, termed SCALE (Semi-supervised Case Annotation for Legal Explanations), exploits structural and semantic regularities in case corpora to identify textual patterns that have both predictable relationships to case decisions and explanatory value. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Artificial intelligence & law; Computational models of argument; Human language technology; Legal reasoning; Machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Cost engineering; Engineering education; Forecasting; Learning systems; Semantics; Supervised learning; Computational model; Decision supports; Human language technologies; Legal reasoning; Maintenance cost; Manual processing; Outcome prediction; Semi-supervised method; Decision support systems","Al-Abdulkarim, L., Atkinson, K., Bench-Capon, T.J.M., Whittle, S., Williams, R., Wolfenden, C., Noise induced hearing loss: An application of the angelic methodology (2017) Legal Knowledge and Information Systems - JURIX 2017: The Thirtieth Annual Conference, pp. 79-88. , Luxembourg, 13-15 December, 2017; Alarie, B., Niblett, A., Yoon, A., (2017) Using Machine Learning to Predict Outcomes in Tax Law, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2855977, December 15, or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn. 2855977; Aletras, N., Tsarapatsanis, D., Preotiuc-Pietro, D., Lampos, V., Predicting judicial decisions of the european court of human rights: A natural language processing perspective (2016) PeerJ CompSci, , https://peerj.com/articles/cs-93, October 24; Aleven, V., Ashley, K., Evaluating a learning environment for case-based argumentation skills (1997) Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 170-179. , ACM Press, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia June 30-July 3; Aleven, V.A.W.M.M., (1997) Teaching Case-based Argumentation through a Model and Examples, , Ph.

Our software prototype 1) applies Text Classification and Text Mining methods on vacancy announcements to decompose jobs into meaningful skills components, which lifelong learners should target; and 2) creates a hybrid OER Recommender System to suggest personalized learning content for learners to progress towards their skill targets. For the first evaluation of this prototype we focused on two job areas: Data Scientist, and Mechanical Engineer. We applied our skill extractor approach and provided OER recommendations for learners targeting these jobs. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 12 subject matter experts to learn how our prototype performs in terms of its objectives, logic, and contribution to learning. More than 150 recommendations were generated, and 76.9% of these recommendations were treated as useful by the interviewees. Interviews revealed that a personalized OER recommender system, based on skills demanded by labour market, has the potential to improve the learning experience of lifelong learners.

The major features of OperaMiner are: (1) It provides a uniform reasoning framework for character relations considering language structure information as well as explicit and implicit expressions in opera scripts. (2) It explores the deep features in opera scripts, including character embeddings features, word embeddings features, and the linguistic features in artistic texts. (3) It presents a hybrid learning architecture enhancing CNN and Bi-LSTM with a CRF layer for character relation extraction. After a brief introduction to the architecture and key technologies of OperaMiner, we present a case study to demonstrate the main features of OperaMiner, including the generation of the character relation graph, the demonstration of major roles, and the evolution sequence of character relations. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Character relation; Deep learning; Opera scripts; Relation extraction","Bismuth compounds; Database systems; Deep learning; Embeddings; Extraction; Linguistics; Long short-term memory; Network architecture; Character relation; Exploration tasks; Hybrid learning architecture; Language structure; Linguistic features; Opera scripts; Reasoning framework; Relation extraction; Deep neural networks","Kadry, A., Dietz, L., Open relation extraction for support passage retrieval: Merit and open issues (2017) SIGIR, pp. 1149-1152. , pp; Ma, X., Hovy, E., End-to-end sequence labeling via bi-directional LSTM-CNNs-CRF (2016) ACL, pp. 1064-1074. , pp; Chiu, J., Nichols, E., (2015) Named Entity Recognition with Bidirectional Lstm-Cnns.

The latest publications on solving problems of recognition and analysis of texts by their images were analyzed, a selected range of application libraries for creating a program for experiments are Keras, TensorFlow, Theano, Pandas, Matplotlib and others. Two variants of recognition technology were analyzed and tested: using fuzzy logic and using deep learning neural networks. To construct and train neural networks, a well-known and rather complete base of handwritten digits MNIST was chosen. Two types of neural networks were considered: sequential and convolutional. The training of neural networks was carried out using a variable number of steps (epochs). Recognition images were scaled to a size of 28x28 (784 cells in a one-dimensional representation). Preliminary processing of images (filtering, scaling, etc.) was carried out using the OpenCV library. For recognition, each image of the digit was converted to a 28x28 size and fed to the input of a pre-trained neural network. A technique to select the area of interest in photographs containing hand-written digits for further recognition has been worked out. For handwritten digit recognition, the best recognition accuracy is provided by a convolutional neural network, with which 97.6% of car ladle digits were correctly recognized.

However, due to the complexity of medical diagnosis and medical research, there are still many unknown problems in this field. With the recent emphasis of the national government and academic agencies in open sharing data and advancement of computational tools, e.g. machine learning and artificial intelligence, there is a renewed hope to tackle such complex problems. One of the fields that can benefit greatly from such advancement is the cancer clinical trial matching. This field has gained a lot of attention due to its complexity and the large number of people it affects. The algorithms proposed in this paper aim to assist clinicians and patients in cancer clinical trial matching by reducing the number of eligible trials using a combination of logical conditions and text mining of trial descriptions. Data for this study is provided by the Clinical Trial website which consists of 100 patients’ demographic and clinical information. Our preliminary results demonstrate the capabilities of unsupervised learning and conditional logic in reducing the matched trials and suggest further exploration for improvement and optimization of clinical trial matching for clinicians. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Agglomerative clustering; Clinical trial matching; Jaccard similarity; Text mining; Unsupervised learning","Artificial intelligence; Data Sharing; Diseases; Medical problems; Text mining; Clinical information; Complex problems; Computational tools; Computer technology; Conditional logic; Medical research; National governments; Number of peoples; Diagnosis","U.S. Cancer Statistics Data Visualizations Tool, Based on 2019 Submission Data (1999-2017), , U.S. department of health and human services, centers for disease control and prevention and national cancer institute; Weir, H.K., The past, present, and future of cancer incidence in the United States: 1975 through 2020 (2015) Cancer, 121 (11), pp. 1827-1837; Unger, J.M., The role of clinical trial participation in cancer research: Barriers, evidence, and strategies (2016) Am.

In practice, however, the crowd often fails at generating innovative solutions, leading to duplicate or ideas that use each other's description. Thus, it is practically and economically unfeasible to sift through this large number of ideas to select valuable ones. One promising solution to overcome this issue is identifying relationships between idea text descriptions, such as duplicate, generalize, disjoint, alternative solution. Existing approaches rely either on human judgment, which is expensive and requires domain experts or automatic approaches which compute similarity i.e. one dimension and do not consider other relations. To find complex relationships between idea texts, a first logical step is to fully structure ideas into logic-based representation. However, logic-based representations are very expensive to obtain since ideas' texts do not adhere to any specific structure. Our goal is then to come up with a representation that can be learned by the machine, while still being expressive to allow establishing relationships between ideas. This research in progress introduces an approach based on a sequence-to-sequence learning approach, which allows the machine to learn a lightweight structural representation that is used next to establishing multidimensional relationships between ideas (i.e. different kind of relations between ideas). Based on our investigation, we found out that ideas contain the following patterns: what the idea is about (e.g. window with heat-sensitive material), how it works (e.g. it lights up) and when it works (e.g. in case of fire). Those extracted patterns are then compared with the corresponding patterns of other ideas to establish relations. Our preliminary investigation shows promising results to learn such lightweight structural representation and leverages it in identifying complex relationships between ideas. © 2020 IEEE.","Knowledge-extraction; Lightweight knowledge representation; Machine learning; Patterns discovery; Sequence to sequence learning","Computation theory; Semantics; Alternative solutions; Automatic approaches; Complex relationships; Heat-sensitive materials; Innovative solutions; Light-weight representation; Logic-based representation; Structural representation; Computer circuits","Khiat, A., Mackeprang, M., Müller-Birn, C., (2018) Innovonto: An Enhanced Crowd Ideation Platform with Semantic Annotation (Hallway Test); Siangliulue, P., Chan, J., Dow, S.P., Gajos, K.Z., Ideahound: Improving large-scale collaborative ideation with crowd-powered realtime semantic modeling (2016) Proc. of the 29th UIST, pp. 609-624; Westerski, A., (2013) Semantic Technologies in Idea Management Systems: A Model for Interoperability, Linking and Filtering, , Ph.

Over the past two decades, consumers have begun to use smart devices to both take in and generate a large volume of open-source text-based data, providing the opportunity for latent anomaly analysis. However, real-time data acquisition, and the processing and interpretation of various types of unstructured data, remains a great challenge. Recent efforts have focused on artificial intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) solutions to accelerate the labor-intensive linear collection, exploitation, and dissemination analysis cycle and enhance it with a data-driven rapid integration and correlation process of open-source data. This paper describes an Activity Based Intelligence framework for anomaly detection of open-source big data using AI/ML to perform semantic analysis. The proposed Anomaly Detection using Semantic Analysis Knowledge (ADUSAK) framework includes four layers: input layer, knowledge layer, reasoning layer, and graphical user interface (GUI)/output layer. The corresponding main technologies include: Information Extraction, Knowledge Graph (KG) construction, Semantic Reasoning, and Pattern Discovery. Finally, ADUSAK was verified by performing Emerging Events Detection, Fake News Detection, and Suspicious Network Analysis. The generalized ADUSAK framework can be easily extended to a wide range of applications by adjusting the data collection, modeling construction, and event alerting. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Learning this notation typically requires many years of experience and is not an explicit part of undergraduate academic curricula. Constructing and comprehending logical predicates can feel difficult and unintuitive. We hypothesized that this process can be automated using neural machine translation. Most machine translation techniques involve word-based segmentation as a preprocessing step. Given the nature of our custom dataset, hosts first-order-logic (FOL) semantics primarily in unigram tokens, the word-based approach does not seem applicable. The proposed solution was to automate the translation of short English sentences into FOL expressions using character-level prediction in a recurrent neural network model. We trained four encoder-decoder models (LSTM, Bidirectional GRU with Attention, and two variants of Bi-directional LSTM with Attention). Our experimental results showed that several established neural translation techniques can be implemented to produce highly accurate machine translators of English sentences to FOL formalisms, given only characters as markers of semantics. We also demonstrated that attention-based enhancement to the encoder-decoder architecture can vastly improve translation accuracy.

We exploit multiple levels of feature maps of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network, as well as contextualized word and sentence embeddings extracted from a character-based language model. Following dedicated non-linear mappings for visual features at each level, word, and sentence embeddings, we obtain multiple instantiations of our common semantic space in which comparisons between any target text and the visual content is performed with cosine similarity. We guide the model by a multi-level multimodal attention mechanism which outputs attended visual features at each level. The best level is chosen to be compared with text content for maximizing the pertinence scores of image-sentence pairs of the ground truth. Experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets show significant performance gains (20%-60% relative) over the state-of-the-art in phrase localization and set a new performance record on those datasets. We provide a detailed ablation study to show the contribution of each element of our approach and release our code on GitHub. © 2019 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Representation Learning; Vision + Language; Visual Reasoning","Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Embeddings; Semantics; Attention mechanisms; Cosine similarity; Nonlinear mappings; Performance Gain; Representation Learning; State of the art; Visual modalities; Visual reasoning; Visual languages","Anderson, P., He, X., Buehler, C., Teney, D., Johnson, M., Gould, S., Zhang, L., Bottom-up and top-down attention for image captioning and visual question answering (2018) CVPR, 3, p. 6; Antol, S., Agrawal, A., Lu, J., Mitchell, M., Batra, D., Lawrence Zitnick, C., Parikh, D., Vqa: Visual question answering (2015) International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV); Chelba, C., Mikolov, T., Schuster, M., Ge, Q., Brants, T., Koehn, P., Robinson, T., One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling (2014) Fifteenth Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association; Chen, K., Gao, J., Nevatia, R., Knowledge aided consistency for weakly supervised phrase grounding (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Chen, K., Kovvuri, R., Gao, J., Nevatia, R., Msrc: Multimodal spatial regression with semantic context for phrase grounding (2018) International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval, 7 (1), pp. 17-28; Chen, K., Kovvuri, R., Nevatia, R., Query-guided regression network with context policy for phrase grounding (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV); Chen, L., Zhang, H., Xiao, J., Nie, L., Shao, J., Liu, W., Chua, T., Sca-cnn: Spatial and channel-wise attention in convolutional networks for image captioning (2017) 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 6298-6306. , IEEE; Deng, C., Wu, Q., Wu, Q., Hu, F., Lyu, F., Tan, M., Visual grounding via accumulated attention (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 7746-7755; Engilberge, M., Chevallier, L., Pérez, P., Cord, M., Finding beans in burgers: Deep semanticvisual embedding with localization (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3984-3993; Fang, H., Gupta, S., Iandola, F., Srivastava, R.K., Deng, L., Dollár, P., Gao, J., Platt, J.C., From captions to visual concepts and back (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1473-1482; Fukui, A., Huk Park, D., Yang, D., Rohrbach, A., Darrell, T., Rohrbach, M., Multimodal compact bilinear pooling for visual question answering and visual grounding (2016) Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing; Gordo, A., Almazán, J., Revaud, J., Larlus, D., Deep image retrieval: Learning global representations for image search (2016) European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 241-257. , Springer; Grubinger, M., Clough, P., Müller, H., Deselaers, T., The iapr tc-12 benchmark: A new evaluation resource for visual information systems (2006) Int.

Inspired by this trend, we study the question of how Transformer-based models can improve the performance of sequential decision-making agents. We present the Working Memory Graph (WMG), an agent that employs multi-head selfattention to reason over a dynamic set of vectors representing observed and recurrent state. We evaluate WMG in three environments featuring factored observation spaces: A Pathfinding environment that requires complex reasoning over past observations, BabyAI gridworld levels that involve variable goals, and Sokoban which emphasizes future planning. We find that the combination of WMG s Transformer-based architecture with factored observation spaces leads to significant gains in learning efficiency compared to baseline architectures across all tasks. WMG demonstrates how Transformer-based models can dramatically boost sample efficiency in RL environments for which observations can be factored. © 2020 37th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2020.

WordNet is an excellent relational dictionary, but it lacks deep semantic topology function because of its index-based text storage structure. As a graphical database, Neo4J provides visualization of its internal data. Since the abstract data structure in WordNet matches Neo4J’s ternary storage structure, it is very suitable to map WordNet completely with Neo4J graph instance. This paper studies how to fully describe WordNet in Neo4J through a ternary structure. Neo4J stores the data as graphs (nodes and edges) and provides certain native graph algorithms to search the data. The speed of matching query between nodes is varying linearly with the number of nodes, so the efficiency of basic operation is guaranteed. With the help of Neo4J, VSRDM works as a semantic dictionary providing relationships matching, reasoning auxiliary and other functions. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Knowledge-Driven; Neo4J; Semantic relations; WordNet","Abstracting; Data visualization; Digital storage; Graph Databases; Machine learning; Query processing; Semantics; Abstract data structures; Automatic inference; Knowledge-Driven; Neo4J; Semantic dictionaries; Semantic relations; Storage structures; Wordnet; Ontology","Miller, G.A., WordNet: A lexical database for English (1995) Commun.

While humans complement interpretations of others' faces with additional reasoning about context, automated approaches rarely display such context-sensitivity. Empirical findings indicate that the personal memories triggered by videos are crucial for predicting viewers' emotional response to such videos ?- in some cases, even more so than the video's audiovisual content. In this article, we explore the benefits of personal memories as context for facial behavior analysis. We conduct a series of multimodal machine learning experiments combining the automatic analysis of video-viewers' faces with that of two types of context information for affective predictions: \beginenumerate∗[label=(\arabic∗)] \item self-reported free-text descriptions of triggered memories and \item a video's audiovisual content \endenumerate∗. Our results demonstrate that both sources of context provide models with information about variation in viewers' affective responses that complement facial analysis and each other. © 2020 ACM.","affect detection; context-awareness; emotion recognition","Audiovisual; Forecasting; Interactive computer systems; Affective response; Audio-visual content; Automated approach; Automatic analysis; Context information; Context sensitivity; Emotional response; Empirical findings; Modal analysis","Baccianella, S., Esuli, A., Sebastiani, F., Sentiwordnet 3. 0: An enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2010) Lrec, 10, pp. 2200-2204; Baltrusaitis, T., Zadeh, A., Lim, Y.C., Morency, L., Openface 2. 0: Facial behavior analysis toolkit (2018) 2018 13th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2018), pp. 59-66. , https://doi.org/10.1109/FG.2018.00019; Barrett, L.F., Adolphs, R., Marsella, S., Martinez, A.M., Pollak, S.D., Emotional expressions reconsidered: Challenges to inferring emotion from human facial movements (2019) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 20 (1), pp. 1-68. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1529100619832930, jul 2019; Bartsch, A., Emotional gratification in entertainment experience (2012) Why Viewers of Movies and Television Series Find It Rewarding to Experience Emotions.

Hence, even well-established Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems, such as Abby, OCRopus, Tesseract, etc., fail to give sufficient recognition accuracy for historical archives, since they are optimized for transcribing contemporary documents. In contrast, the open-source anyOCR system is designed specifically for digitizing historical documents with state-of-the-art image processing techniques, to achieve high accuracy. Nowadays, the retrieval of historical document images for further OCR requires special scanning devices that are bulky and stationary. As a result, a portable device that combines scanning and OCR capabilities is beneficial to transcribe documents without the need to remove them from where they are archived. For example, smart goggles equipped with embedded OCR device can be used for instant word spotting. However, the available anyOCR software implementation has long runtime and high power consumption. As a solution, we propose a low power, energy-efficient accelerator with real-time capabilities called iDocChip, which is a hybrid hardware-software programmable System-on-Chip (SoC) for digitizing historical documents. This chip can be easily integrated in a portable device. This paper focuses on one of the most crucial processing steps in anyOCR: Text line extraction. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first hybrid hardware-software architecture of the text line extraction technique implemented on an FPGA based programmable SoC. The resulting custom hardware accelerator outperforms the existing anyOCR software implementation by 120x, while achieving 1700x higher energy efficiency without affecting the high accuracy of the system. © 2019 IEEE.","FPGA;

One of the most important facts is to read the news over the internet by using different social media applications. There are so many apps and websites as we see on the internet today that will be providing the news with proper authentication factors. But there is one question in everyone's minds that the news that is rolling over the internet is fake or true. Most of the news is always roll over the social media application like Facebook, Twitter, and sometimes on WhatsApp. There are two sides to using social media for news consumption. On the one side, people are attracted to social media because of its low cost, ease of access, and speed at which content is disseminated. On the other hand, it facilitates the spread of fake news, or low-quality news containing deliberately deceptive information. The mass distribution of false information has the potential to be extremely dangerous to individuals and society. As a result, spotting fake news on social media has emerged as a hot new research subject. Fake news monitoring on social media has distinct appearances and features, leaving outdated identification algorithms unreliable or obsolete. First, fake news is intentionally written to lead viewers to accept misleading facts, making it impossible and time-consuming to spot based on news content; as a result, we must have supporting data, such as using social networking interactions on social media, to help in decision-making. Second, as users' social experiences with fake news produce data that is massive, unreliable, shapeless, and noisy, misusing this auxiliary data is motivating in and of itself. We commissioned this survey to assist researchers in better understanding the difficulty of identifying fake news on social media, which is both complex and important. We will also like to discuss related research areas, open topics, and future research ideas for spotting false news on social media. It is very violated towards society to saw such fake news over the internet that is going to happen every day. Our paper will help to detect fake news with the use of python and some machine learning algorithm. It will tell the user that the news that is on the internet is fake or real by using SVM. Our model is working perfectly with good efficiency over the trained dataset. © 2021 IEEE.","Fuzzy logic; Machine Learning Algorithm; Naive Bayes Algorithm; Natural Language Processing; Support Vector Machine(SVM)","Behavioral research; Decision making; Learning systems; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; User experience; Auxiliary data; Deceptive information; Identification algorithms; Low qualities; Mass distribution; News content; Research subjects; Social media; Learning algorithms","Granik, M., Mesyura, V., Fake news detection using naive Bayes classifier (2017) 2017 IEEE 1st Ukr.

This is problematic not only for lack of transparency, but also for possible biases inherited by the algorithms from human prejudices and collection artifacts hidden in the training data, which may lead to unfair or wrong decisions. We focus on the urgent open challenge of how to construct meaningful explanations of opaque AI/ML systems, introducing the local-to-global framework for black box explanation, articulated along three lines: (i) the language for expressing explanations in terms of logic rules, with statistical and causal interpretation; (ii) the inference of local explanations for revealing the decision rationale for a specific case, by auditing the black box in the vicinity of the target instance; (iii), the bottom-up generalization of many local explanations into simple global ones, with algorithms that optimize for quality and comprehensibility. We argue that the local-first approach opens the door to a wide variety of alternative solutions along different dimensions: a variety of data sources (relational, text, images, etc.), a variety of learning problems (multi-label classification, regression, scoring, ranking), a variety of languages for expressing meaningful explanations, a variety of means to audit a black box. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Cluster analysis, based on some criteria, shares data into important, practical or both categories (clusters) based on shared common characteristics. In research, clustering and classification have been used to analyze data, in the field of machine learning, bioinformatics, statistics, pattern recognition to mention a few. Different methods of clustering include Partitioning (K-means), Hierarchical (AGNES), Density-based (DBSCAN), Grid-based (STING), Soft clustering (FANNY), Model-based (SOM) and Ensemble clustering. Challenges and problems in clustering arise from large datasets, misinterpretation of results and efficiency/performance of clustering algorithms, which is necessary for choosing clustering algorithms. In this paper, application of data clustering was systematically discussed in view of the characteristics of the different clustering techniques that make them better suited or biased when applied to several types of data, such as uncertain data, multimedia data, graph data, biological data, stream data, text data, time series data, categorical data and big data. The suitability of the available clustering algorithms to different application areas was presented. Also investigated were some existing cluster validity methods used to evaluate the goodness of the clusters produced by the clustering algorithms. © 2019 IEEE.","cluster analysis; cluster validity; Clustering; clustering algorithms; model-based clustering","Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Computer aided diagnosis; Large dataset; Pattern recognition; Application area; Cluster validity; Clustering; Clustering techniques; Ensemble clustering; ITS applications; Model-based clustering; Time-series data; K-means clustering","Jain, A.K., Data clustering: 50 years beyond K-means (2010) Pattern Recognit.

However, efficient implementation suffers from very sequential execution that tremendously slows down both training and inference compared to other neural networks. This is the primary reason that prevents intensive research involving MD-LSTM in the recent years, despite large progress in microelectronics and architectures. The main goal of the current research is to provide acceleration for inference of MD-LSTM, so to open a door for efficient training that can boost application of MD-LSTM. By this research we advocate that FPGA is an alternative platform for deep learning that can offer a solution in cases when a massive parallelism of GPUs does not provide the necessary performance required by the application. In this paper, we present the first hardware architecture for MD-LSTM. We conduct a systematic exploration of precision vs. accuracy trade-off using challenging dataset for historical document image binarization from DIBCO 2017 contest, and well known MNIST dataset for handwritten digits recognition. Based on our new architecture we implement FPGA-based accelerator that outperforms NVIDIA K80 GPU implementation in terms of runtime by up to 50× and energy efficiency by up to 746×. At the same time, our accelerator demonstrates higher accuracy and comparable throughput in comparison with state-of-the-art FPGA-based implementations of multilayer perceptron for MNIST dataset. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","2D-LSTM; Deep Learning; DIBCO; FPGA; Hardware Architecture; Image Binarization; Long Short-Term Memory; LSTM; MD-LSTM; MNIST; Zynq","Arts computing; Brain; Character recognition; Deep learning; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Graphics processing unit; Logic gates; Medical imaging; Memory architecture; Microelectronics; Network architecture; Program processors; 2D-LSTM; DIBCO; Hardware architecture; Image binarization; LSTM; MNIST; Zynq; Long short-term memory","http://pytorch.org/, [n. d.]; https://xilinxwikiatlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18841813/Zynq+UltraScale+MP\SoC+Power+Management, [n. d.].

Several methods based on Machine Learning are currently available, even if their precision is still outperformed by med- ical doctors. In this field there are some intrinsic limitations to ML ap- proaches, such as the cost and time to acquire high quality annotated scans for training; a considerably high variability of organs morphol- ogy due to age, health conditions, genetics; acquisition noise. This pa- per outlines a new methodology based on Answer Set Programming, which returns reliable, easy-to-program and explainable interpretations. In particular, we focus on the CT scan analysis and retrieval of tree-like structure, corresponding to main blood vessels (arteries) arrangement. The structure is compared to the knowledge base of vessels contained in anatomy text-books. The mapping of vessels names is computed by an ASP program. This preliminary step produces a robust input to a reasoner for the multi-organ labeling and localization problem. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

However, the reasoning behind the state-of-the-art black-box learning and prediction models has become obscured and this resultant lack of transparency has presented a problem whereby physicians are unable to trust the results of these systems. This motivated us to improve the conventional CAD with a more robust and interpretable algorithms to produce a system that achieves high accuracy and explainable diagnoses of lung cancer. The proposed approach uses a novel image processing pipeline to segment nodules from lung CT scan images, and then classifies the nodule using both 2D and 3D Alexnet models that have been trained on lung nodule data from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The explainability aspect is approached from two angles: 1) LIME that produces a visual explanation of the diagnosis, and 2) a rule-based system that produces a text-based explanation of the diagnosis. Overall, the proposed algorithm has achieved better performance and advance the practicality of CAD systems. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cancer detection; Deep learning; Explainable AI; Image processing; Machine vision","Biological organs; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer vision; Diseases; Image segmentation; Intelligent robots; Lime; Medical imaging; Predictive analytics; Robotics; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); High-accuracy; Image processing pipeline; Lung Cancer; Lung cancer detections; Lung nodule; Prediction model; State of the art; Computerized tomography","Tech.

In some cases, there could be just one sample. So, the defense system at the firing line must be able to quickly detect many automatically generated variants using a single malware instance observed from the initial outbreak by statically inspecting the binary executables. As previous research works show, statistical features such as term frequency-inverse document frequency and n-gram are significantly vulnerable to attacks by mutation through reinforcement learning. Recent studies focus on raw binary executable as a base feature which contains instructions describing the core logic of the sample. However, many approaches using image-matching neural networks are insufficient due to the malware mutation technique that generates a large number of samples with high entropy data. Deriving instruction cognitive representation that disambiguates legitimate instructions from the context is necessary for accurate detection over raw binary executables. In this paper, we present a novel method of detecting semantically similar malware variants within a campaign using a single raw binary malware executable. We utilize Discrete Fourier Transform of instruction cognitive representation extracted from self-attention transformer network. The experiments were conducted with in-the-wild malware samples from ransomware and banking Trojan campaigns. The proposed method outperforms several state of the art binary classification models. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Deep learning; Instruction recognition; One to many malware; Outbreak detection; Raw binary executable; Self-attention transformer","Discrete Fourier transforms; Inverse problems; Reinforcement learning; Text processing; Automatically generated; Binary classification; Binary executables; Number of samples; Outbreak detection; State of the art; Statistical features; Term frequency-inverse document frequencies; Malware","Saxe, J., Berlin, K., Deep neural network based malware detection using two dimensional binary program features (2015) 2015 10th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALWARE).
