BAMGPUCX,Sentence-Level Classification Using Parallel Fuzzy Deep Learning Classifier,"At present, with the growing number of Web 2.0 platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, users honestly communicate their opinions and ideas about events, services, and products. Owing to this rise in the number of social platforms and their extensive use by people, enormous amounts of data are produced hourly. However, sentiment analysis or opinion mining is considered as a useful tool that aims to extract the emotion and attitude from the user-posted data on social media platforms by using different computational methods to linguistic terms and various Natural Language Processing (NLP). Therefore, enhancing text sentiment classification accuracy has become feasible, and an interesting research area for many community researchers. In this study, a new Fuzzy Deep Learning Classifier (FDLC) is suggested for improving the performance of data-sentiment classification. Our proposed FDLC integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build an effective automatic process for extracting the features from collected unstructured data and Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) to compute both positive and negative sentimental scores. Then, we used the Mamdani Fuzzy System (MFS) as a fuzzy classifier to classify the outcomes of the two used deep (CNN+FFNN) learning models in three classes, which are: Neutral, Negative, and Positive. Also, to prevent the long execution time taking by our hybrid proposed FDLC, we have implemented our proposal under the Hadoop cluster. An experimental comparative study between our FDLC and some other suggestions from the literature is performed to demonstrate our offered classifier's effectiveness. The empirical result proved that our FDLC performs better than other classifiers in terms of true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive rate, false negative rate, error rate, precision, classification rate, kappa statistic, F1-score and time consumption, complexity, convergence, and stability. © 2013 IEEE."
JN4IZETG,autoBOT: evolving neuro-symbolic representations for explainable low resource text classification,"Learning from texts has been widely adopted throughout industry and science. While state-of-the-art neural language models have shown very promising results for text classification, they are expensive to (pre-)train, require large amounts of data and tuning of hundreds of millions or more parameters. This paper explores how automatically evolved text representations can serve as a basis for explainable, low-resource branch of models with competitive performance that are subject to automated hyperparameter tuning. We present autoBOT (automatic Bags-Of-Tokens), an autoML approach suitable for low resource learning scenarios, where both the hardware and the amount of data required for training are limited. The proposed approach consists of an evolutionary algorithm that jointly optimizes various sparse representations of a given text (including word, subword, POS tag, keyword-based, knowledge graph-based and relational features) and two types of document embeddings (non-sparse representations). The key idea of autoBOT is that, instead of evolving at the learner level, evolution is conducted at the representation level. The proposed method offers competitive classification performance on fourteen real-world classification tasks when compared against a competitive autoML approach that evolves ensemble models, as well as state-of-the-art neural language models such as BERT and RoBERTa. Moreover, the approach is explainable, as the importance of the parts of the input space is part of the final solution yielded by the proposed optimization procedure, offering potential for meta-transfer learning. © 2021, The Author(s)."
KTEHK4MZ,Deepening the IDA* algorithm for knowledge graph reasoning through neural network architecture,"Inferring missing links in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a key evaluation task for KG reasoning, which aims to find relations for a given entity pair. Existing research often employs the IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*) algorithm for the path discovery task owing to its efficiency and accuracy. However, it relies on heuristics to set cost functions and is also difficult to utilize useful context information in the search process. In this paper, we propose the Deep-IDA* framework which applies neural networks and reinforcement learning (RL) to empower the IDA* algorithm to tackle the path discovery problem in KG reasoning. We model KG reasoning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and divide our Deep-IDA* framework and the resulting path into two parts: path-finding and path-reasoning. For path-finding, we propose a policy network to model the cost from the source to a candidate location. In this process, we employ the GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) to embed the observable sub-track, then employ the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to record the historical trajectory, and introduce the attention to utilize the context information, and finally form policy. For path-reasoning with the searched candidate paths passed from the former process, we employ a value network to estimate the cost from the candidate to the destination entity, using the GNN (Graph Neural Networks) to learn a message-passing algorithm that solves the path inference problem, and using the GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) to update the historical information. Finally, the actor-learner algorithm is utilized to minimize the sum of the losses of the two parts. Experiment results on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."
RDSQSBN7,Relation Extraction in Dialogues: A Deep Learning Model Based on the Generality and Specialty of Dialogue Text,"Relation extraction from dialogue text is an innovative task in natural language processing. In addition to the general characteristics of general relation extraction from news or scientific publication text, the task is of certain special features. For example, the context in dialogues frequently switches between speakers, and there exist rich pronoun anaphora in the dialogue text. Thus, it is important for the model to be aware of such features to improve the performance. Taking these factors together, we propose an end to-end neural model for dialogue-based relation extraction, which includes four modules to handle the problems existing in the task from different aspects: (1) the word-relation attention to model a natural intuition that different words contribute differently for the identification of different relations; (2) the graph reasoning to consider the global context information in the dialogue that contains many inter-sentence relations; (3) the speaker embeddings to incorporate speaker information into our model; (4) the speaker coreference to associate pronouns with speakers and enrich the information of graph reasoning. Our model was evaluated on a recently-proposed dataset for dialogue-based relation extraction, and achieved the state of the-art performance. We show that our proposed modules are effective through ablation studies. Our work can be a competitive benchmark for the study of dialogue based relation extraction. IEEE"
7MMJY5BM,The CoRg Project: Cognitive Reasoning,"The term cognitive computing refers to new hardware and/or software that mimics the functioning of the human brain. In the context of question answering and commonsense reasoning this means that the reasoning process of humans shall be modeled by adequate technical means. However, since humans do not follow the rules of classical logic, a system designed to model these abilities must be very versatile. The aim of the CoRg project (Cognitive Reasoning) is to successfully complete a reasoning task with commonsense reasoning. We address different benchmarks with focus on the COPA benchmark set (Choice of Plausible Alternatives). Since humans naturally use background knowledge, we have to deal with large background knowledge bases and must be able to reason with multiple input formats and sources in the CoRg system, in order to draw explainable conclusions. For this, we have to find appropriate logics for cognitive reasoning. For a successful reasoning system, nowadays it seems to be important to combine automated reasoning with machine learning technology like recurrent neural networks. © 2019, Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
NB39QA35,Learning to activate logic rules for textual reasoning,"Most current textual reasoning models cannotlearn human-like reasoning process, and thus lack interpretability and logical accuracy. To help address this issue, we propose a novel reasoning model which learns to activate logic rules explicitly via deep reinforcement learning. It takes the form of Memory Networks but features a special memory that stores relational tuples, mimicking the “Image Schema” in human cognitive activities. We redefine textual reasoning as a sequential decision-making process modifying or retrieving from the memory, where logic rules serve as state-transition functions. Activating logic rules for reasoning involves two problems: variable binding and relation activating, and this is a first step to solve them jointly. Our model achieves an average error rate of 0.7% on bAbI-20, a widely-used synthetic reasoning benchmark, using less than 1k training samples and no supporting facts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"
7Q5JRVK2,Semantic-based regularization for learning and inference,"This paper proposes a unified approach to learning from constraints, which integrates the ability of classical machine learning techniques to learn from continuous feature-based representations with the ability of reasoning using higher-level semantic knowledge typical of Statistical Relational Learning. Learning tasks are modeled in the general framework of multi-objective optimization, where a set of constraints must be satisfied in addition to the traditional smoothness regularization term. The constraints translate First Order Logic formulas, which can express learning-from-example supervisions and general prior knowledge about the environment by using fuzzy logic. By enforcing the constraints also on the test set, this paper presents a natural extension of the framework to perform collective classification. Interestingly, the theory holds for both the case of data represented by feature vectors and the case of data simply expressed by pattern identifiers, thus extending classic kernel machines and graph regularization, respectively. This paper also proposes a probabilistic interpretation of the proposed learning scheme, and highlights intriguing connections with probabilistic approaches like Markov Logic Networks. Experimental results on classic benchmarks provide clear evidence of the remarkable improvements that are obtained with respect to related approaches. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."
ACDMDN8W,A new neutrosophic TF-IDF term weighting for text mining tasks: text classification use case,"Purpose: This paper aims to present a new term weighting approach for text classification as a text mining task. The original method, neutrosophic term frequency – inverse term frequency (NTF-IDF), is an extended version of the popular fuzzy TF-IDF (FTF-IDF) and uses the neutrosophic reasoning to analyze and generate weights for terms in natural languages. The paper also propose a comparative study between the popular FTF-IDF and NTF-IDF and their impacts on different machine learning (ML) classifiers for document categorization goals. Design/methodology/approach: After preprocessing textual data, the original Neutrosophic TF-IDF applies the neutrosophic inference system (NIS) to produce weights for terms representing a document. Using the local frequency TF, global frequency IDF and text N's length as NIS inputs, this study generate two neutrosophic weights for a given term. The first measure provides information on the relevance degree for a word, and the second one represents their ambiguity degree. Next, the Zhang combination function is applied to combine neutrosophic weights outputs and present the final term weight, inserted in the document's representative vector. To analyze the NTF-IDF impact on the classification phase, this study uses a set of ML algorithms. Findings: Practicing the neutrosophic logic (NL) characteristics, the authors have been able to study the ambiguity of the terms and their degree of relevance to represent a document. NL's choice has proven its effectiveness in defining significant text vectorization weights, especially for text classification tasks. The experimentation part demonstrates that the new method positively impacts the categorization. Moreover, the adopted system's recognition rate is higher than 91%, an accuracy score not attained using the FTF-IDF. Also, using benchmarked data sets, in different text mining fields, and many ML classifiers, i.e. SVM and Feed-Forward Network, and applying the proposed term scores NTF-IDF improves the accuracy by 10%. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper lies in two aspects. First, a new term weighting method, which uses the term frequencies as components to define the relevance and the ambiguity of term; second, the application of NL to infer weights is considered as an original model in this paper, which also aims to correct the shortcomings of the FTF-IDF which uses fuzzy logic and its drawbacks. The introduced technique was combined with different ML models to improve the accuracy and relevance of the obtained feature vectors to fed the classification mechanism. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."
2PNFHS7L,Heterogeneous graph reasoning for knowledge-grounded medical dialogue system,"Beyond the common difficulties faced in task-oriented dialogue system, medical dialogue has recently attracted increasing attention due to its huge application potential while posing more challenges in reasoning over medical domain knowledge and logic. Existing works resort to neural language models for dialogue embedding and neglect the explicit logical reasoning, leading to poor explainable and generalization ability. In this work, we propose an explainable Heterogeneous Graph Reasoning (HGR) model to unify the relational dialogue context understanding and entity-correlation reasoning into a heterogeneous graph structure. HGR encodes entity context according to the corresponding utterance and deduces next response after fusing the underlying medical knowledge with entity context by attentional graph propagation. To push forward the future research on expert-sensitive task-oriented dialogue system, we first release a large-scale Medical Dialogue Consultant benchmark (MDG-C) with 16 Gastrointestinal diseases for evaluating consultant capability and a Medical Dialogue Diagnosis benchmark (MDG-D) with 6 diseases for measuring diagnosis capability of models, respectively. Extensive experiments on both MDG-C and MDG-D benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our HGR over state-of-the-art knowledge grounded approaches in general fields of medical dialogue system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."
2AVPZCMD,Effective feature representation using symbolic approach for classification and clustering of big data,"The tremendous growth in the technology has led to the accumulation of enormous Big Data. Techniques that efficiently analyse this Big Data are in great demand. Tweets from Social media and Sensor data are some of the most common forms of Big Data. Machine learning algorithms pave way for researchers to analyze Big Data. Most Machine learning algorithms depend on efficient feature extraction and feature selection for its success. Here, we explore feature selection methods like entropy and Rough set on the sensor data. Also a symbolic approach of feature extraction is proposed which represents both sensor and twitter data efficiently for further data analysis. Some popular classifiers like Naïve Bayes, K Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree are used for validating the efficacy of the features selected. An ensemble classifier technique is also proposed which is compared with various state of the art ensemble classifiers. Symbolic features perform better than both entropy and Rough set features for sensor data and improves the clustering efficiency of twitter data. The proposed ensemble weighted average classifier on Symbolic features outperform all the other ensemble classifiers and independent classifiers. The results obtained from these methods have the potential to aid the public health surveillance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
3YFVRRKE,Hierarchical Graph Transformer-Based Deep Learning Model for Large-Scale Multi-Label Text Classification,"Traditional methods of multi-label text classification, particularly deep learning, have achieved remarkable results. However, most of these methods use word2vec technology to represent sequential text information, while ignoring the logic and internal hierarchy of the text itself. Although these approaches can learn the hypothetical hierarchy and logic of the text, it is unexplained. In addition, the traditional approach treats labels as independent individuals and ignores the relationships between them, which not only does not reflect reality but also causes significant loss of semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Transformer based deep learning model for large-scale multi-label text classification. We first model the text into a graph structure that can embody the different semantics of the text and the connections between them. We then use a multi-layer transformer structure with a multi-head attention mechanism at the word, sentence, and graph levels to fully capture the features of the text and observe the importance of the separate parts. Finally, we use the hierarchical relationship of the labels to generate the representation of the labels, and design a weighted loss function based on the semantic distances of the labels. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrated that the proposed model can realistically capture the hierarchy and logic of text and improve performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2013 IEEE."
4EF4BXD9,Solving the twitter sentiment analysis problem based on a machine learning-based approach,"Twitter Sentiment Analysis (TSA) as part of a text classification task has been widely attended by researchers in recent years. This paper presents a machine learning approach to solving the TSA problem in three phases. In the second phase, a suitable value for representing each feature in the Vector Space Model is determined through the weighted combination of the values obtained from four methods (i.e., Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency, semantic similarity, sentiment scoring using SentiWordNet, and sentiment scoring based on the class of tweets). In this manner, finding the percentage of contributions or weights of each method is defined as an optimization problem and solved using a genetic algorithm. Also, the weighted values obtained from four methods are combined based on the Einstein sum as an important T-conorm method. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is tested based on the accuracy of support vector machine and multinomial naïve Bayes classification algorithms on four famous Twitter datasets, namely the Stanford testing dataset, STS-Gold dataset, Obama-McCain Debate dataset, and Strict Obama-McCain Debate dataset. The obtained results show the high superiority of the proposed method in comparison with the other methods. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
74QZV8X9,Robust reasoning over heterogeneous textual information for fact verification,"Automatic fact verification (FV) based on artificial intelligence is considered as a promising approach which can be used to identify misinformation distributed on the web. Even though previous FV using deep learning have made great achievements in single dataset (e.g., FEVER), the trained systems are unlikely to be capable of extracting evidence from heterogeneous web-sources and validating claims in accordance with evidence found on the Internet. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity covers abundant semantic information, which will help FV system identify misinformation in a more accurate way. The current work is the first attempt to make the combination of knowledge graph (KG) and graph neural network (GNN) to enhance the robustness of FV systems for heterogeneous information. As a result, it can be generalized to multi-domain datasets after training on a sufficient single one. To make information update and aggregate well on the collaborative graph, the present study proposes a double graph attention network (DGAT) framework which recursively propagates the embeddings from a node's neighbors to refine the node's embedding as well as applies an attention mechanism to classify the importance of the neighbors. We train and evaluate our system on FEVER, a single and benchmark dataset for FV, and then re-evaluate our system on UKP Snopes Corpus, a new richly annotated corpus for FV tasks on the basis of heterogeneous web sources. According to experimental results, although DGAT has no excellent advantages in a single dataset, it shows outstanding performance in more realistic and multi-domain datasets. Moreover, the current study also provides a feasible method for deep learning to have the ability to infer heterogeneous information robustly. © 2013 IEEE."
EGI547RA,Question Answering Systems with Deep Learning-Based Symbolic Processing,"The authors propose methods to learn symbolic processing with deep learning and to build question answering systems by means of learned models. Symbolic processing, performed by the Prolog processing systems which execute unification, resolution, and list operations, is learned by a combination of deep learning models, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Word2Vec training. To our knowledge, the implementation of a Prolog-like processing system using deep learning is a new experiment that has not been conducted in the past. The results of their experiments revealed that the proposed methods are superior to the conventional methods because symbolic processing (1) has rich representations, (2) can interpret inputs even if they include unknown symbols, and (3) can be learned with a small amount of training data. In particular (2), handling of unknown data, which is a major task in artificial intelligence research, is solved using Word2Vec. Furthermore, question answering systems can be built from knowledge bases written in Prolog with learned symbolic processing, which, with conventional methods, is extremely difficult to accomplish. Their proposed systems can not only answer questions through powerful inferences by utilizing facts that harbor unknown data but also have the potential to build knowledge bases from a large amount of data, including unknown data, on the Web. The proposed systems are a completely new trial, there is no state-of-the-art methods in the sense of 'newest'. Therefore, to evaluate their efficiency, they are compared with the most traditional and robust system i.e., the Prolog system. This is new research that encompasses the subjects of conventional artificial intelligence and neural network, and their systems have higher potential to build applications such as FAQ chatbots, decision support systems and energy-efficient estimation using a large amount of information on the Web. Mining hidden information through these applications will provide great value. © 2013 IEEE."
PD2A2ZVV,"Ontology based E-learning framework: A personalized, adaptive and context aware model","Enhancing the degree of learner productivity, one of the major challenges in E-Learning systems, may be catered through effective personalization, adaptivity and context awareness while recommending the learning contents to the learners. In this paper, an E-Learning framework has been proposed that profiles the learners, categorizes the learners based on profiles, makes personalized content recommendations and performs assessment based content adaptation. A mathematical model has been proposed for learner categorization using machine learning techniques (a hybrid of case based reasoning and neural networks). The learning contents have been annotated through CourseOntology in which three academic courses (each for language of C++, C# and JAVA) have been modeled for the learners. A dynamic rule based recommender has been presented targeting a ‘relative grading system’ for maximizing the learner’s productivity. Performance of proposed framework has been measured in terms of accurate learner categorization, personalized recommendation of the learning contents, completeness and correctness of ontological model and overall performance improvement of learners in academic sessions of 2015, 2016 and 2017. The comparative analysis of proposed framework exhibits visibly improved results compared to prevalent approaches. These improvements are signified to the comprehensive attribute selection in learner profiling, dynamic techniques for learner categorization and effective content recommendation while ensuring personalization and adaptivity. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
GIC4LEU4,Reasoning about goal revelation in human negotiation,"This article studies how people reveal private information in strategic settings in which participants need to negotiate over resources but are uncertain about each other's objectives. The study compares two negotiation protocols that differ in whether they allow participants to disclose their objectives in a repeated negotiation setting of incomplete information. Results show that most people agree to reveal their goals when asked, and this leads participants to more beneficial agreements. Machine learning was used to model the likelihood that people reveal their goals in negotiation, and this model was used to make goal request decisions in the game. In simulation, use of this model is shown to outperform people making the same type of decisions. These results demonstrate the benefit of this approach towards designing agents to negotiate with people under incomplete information. © 2001-2011 IEEE."
2FCUJH2G,From symbolic to sub-symbolic information in question classification,"Question Answering (QA) is undoubtedly a growing field of current research in Artificial Intelligence. Question classification, a QA subtask, aims to associate a category to each question, typically representing the semantic class of its answer. This step is of major importance in the QA process, since it is the basis of several key decisions. For instance, classification helps reducing the number of possible answer candidates, as only answers matching the question category should be taken into account. This paper presents and evaluates a rulebased question classifier that partially founds its performance in the detection of the question headword and in its mapping into the target category through the use ofWordNet. Moreover, we use the rule-based classifier as a features' provider of a machine learning-based question classifier. A detailed analysis of the rule-base contribution is presented. Despite using a very compact feature space, state of the art results are obtained. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010."
