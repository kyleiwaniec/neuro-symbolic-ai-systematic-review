The proposed approach consists of an evolutionary algorithm that jointly optimizes various sparse representations of a given text (including word, subword, POS tag, keyword-based, knowledge graph-based and relational features) and two types of document embeddings (non-sparse representations). The key idea of autoBOT is that, instead of evolving at the learner level, evolution is conducted at the representation level.
",F1,up to 99% on some tasks ,88.89%,"autoBot is a genetic algorithm for text data that learns both the representations and the models for classification jointly. The inclusion of novel symbolic features improves performance over traditional linear models such as SVM and Logistic Regression, and performs on par with large language models such as BERT. The advantage of autoBot is its explainability (feature importances), and efficiency in a low resource setting (small data/feature sparsity, and limited compute power).
The study was conducted using off the shelf implementations and a very basic evolutionary algorithm, thus leaving plenty of room for improvements.
