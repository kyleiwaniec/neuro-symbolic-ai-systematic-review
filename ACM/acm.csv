We also propose an optimal synthesis algorithm that generates all DSL programs that achieve optimal F1 score on the training examples. Our synthesis technique is compositional, prunes the search space by exploiting a monotonicity property of the DSL, and uses transductive learning to select programs with good generalization power.

However, in recent years, the security of locking schemes has been thoroughly challenged by the introduction of various deobfuscation attacks. As in most research branches, deep learning is being introduced in the domain of logic locking as well. Therefore, in this article we present SnapShot, a novel attack on logic locking that is the first of its kind to utilize artificial neural networks to directly predict a key bit value from a locked synthesized gate-level netlist without using a golden reference. Hereby, the attack uses a simpler yet more flexible learning model compared to existing work. Two different approaches are evaluated. The first approach is based on a simple feedforward fully connected neural network. The second approach utilizes genetic algorithms to evolve more complex convolutional neural network architectures specialized for the given task. The attack flow offers a generic and customizable framework for attacking locking schemes using machine learning techniques. We perform an extensive evaluation of SnapShot for two realistic attack scenarios, comprising both reference combinational and sequential benchmark circuits as well as silicon-proven RISC-V core modules. The evaluation results show that SnapShot achieves an average key prediction accuracy of 82.60% for the selected attack scenario, with a significant performance increase of 10.49 percentage points compared to the state of the art. Moreover, SnapShot outperforms the existing technique on all evaluated benchmarks. The results indicate that the security foundation of common logic locking schemes is built on questionable assumptions. Based on the lessons learned, we discuss the vulnerabilities and potentials of logic locking uncovered by SnapShot. The conclusions offer insights into the challenges of designing future logic locking schemes that are resilient to machine learning attacks.","2021-05","2021-07-20 15:23:36","2021-07-20 15:23:36","","","","3","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","deep learning; IP protection; logic locking; neuroevolution; RISC-V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper provides evidence that the practice is quite common among curators, that is used as part of their collaborative practices, and that the embedded knowledge can be mined by algorithms. Further, this meta-knowledge can be integrated, using neuro-symbolic algorithms, to the machine learning-based conversational system, to improve its run-time accuracy and to enable tools to support curatorial tasks.

Reasoning in natural language is a long-term machine-learning goal and is critically needed for building intelligent agents.

This can be achieved by explicit KG reasoning, where a model starts from a user node, sequentially determines the next step, and walks towards an item node of potential interest to the user. However, this is challenging due to the huge search space, unknown destination, and sparse signals over the KG, so informative and effective guidance is needed to achieve a satisfactory recommendation quality. To this end, we propose a CoArse-to-FinE neural symbolic reasoning approach (CAFE). It first generates user profiles as coarse sketches of user behaviors, which subsequently guide a path-finding process to derive reasoning paths for recommendations as fine-grained predictions. User profiles can capture prominent user behaviors from the history, and provide valuable signals about which kinds of path patterns are more likely to lead to potential items of interest for the user. To better exploit the user profiles, an improved path-finding algorithm called Profile-guided Path Reasoning (PPR) is also developed, which leverages an inventory of neural symbolic reasoning modules to effectively and efficiently find a batch of paths over a large-scale KG. We extensively experiment on four real-world benchmarks and observe substantial gains in the recommendation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.","2020","2021-07-20 15:23:37","2021-07-20 15:23:37","","1645–1654","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our framework, Deep-PowerX1, focuses on replacing or removing gates on a technology-mapped network and uses a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict error rates at primary outputs of the circuit when a specific part of the netlist is approximated. The primary goal of Deep-PowerX is to reduce the dynamic power whereas area reduction serves as a secondary objective. Using the said DNN, Deep-PowerX is able to reduce the exponential time complexity of standard approximate logic synthesis to linear time. Experiments are done on numerous open source benchmark circuits. Results show significant reduction in power and area by up to 1.47× and 1.43× compared to exact solutions and by up to 22% and 27% compared to state-of-the-art approximate logic synthesis tools while having orders of magnitudes lower run-time.","2020","2021-07-20 15:23:37","2021-07-20 15:23:37","","73–78","","","","","","","ISLPED '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Boston, Massachusetts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a second step, adopting one of the powerful techniques of machine learning, which is Support Vector Machine (SVM), the authors want to classify data to determine state of the supervision system and learn how to supervise the process preserving habitual linguistic used by operators.","2020-01","2021-07-20 15:23:37","2021-07-20 15:23:37","","92–111","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: USA Publisher: IGI Global","","","","Expert Knowledge; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Fuzzy Logic; Machine Learning Algorithms; Manufacturing; Process Control; Support Vector Machines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the area of artificial intelligence (AI), the two abilities are usually realised by machine learning and logic programming, respectively. However, the two categories of techniques were developed separately throughout most of the history of AI. In this paper, we present the abductive learning targeted at unifying the two AI paradigms in a mutually beneficial way, where the machine learning model learns to perceive primitive logic facts from data, while logical reasoning can exploit symbolic domain knowledge and correct the wrongly perceived facts for improving the machine learning models. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to optimise the machine learning model and the logical reasoning model jointly. We demonstrate that by using abductive learning, machines can learn to recognise numbers and resolve unknown mathematical operations simultaneously from images of simple hand-written equations. Moreover, the learned models can be generalised to longer equations and adapted to different tasks, which is beyond the capability of state-of-the-art deep learning models.","2019","2021-07-20 15:23:37","2021-07-20 15:23:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","Curran Associates Inc.","Red Hook, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Customers can make informed decisions by reading the experiences of other users. In addition, customer feedback can be used by the organizations to further improve the offered services. However, the quintillion bytes of data generated per day in different languages such as Persian consisting of user feedback cannot be manually read and analyzed by an individual or an organization, for gauging public opinion. Sentiment analysis is an automated process of computationally understanding and classifying subjective information in multi disciplinary fields such as products, movies, news, public opinion etc. In this thesis, we focus on developing novel methods for Persian text based sentiment analysis. We exploit the developed text-based methods to improve multimodal polarity detection. Specifically, we develop a novel hybrid framework that integrates dependency-based rules and deep neural networks for detecting polarity in Persian natural language sentences. In addition, we develop a Persian multimodal sentiment analysis framework that integrates audio, visual and textual cues to computationally understand and harvest sentiments from videos posted on social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. Specifically, a first of its kind, multimodal Persian sentiment analysis dataset is developed, which is then used evaluate the proposed multimodal framework that exploits the hybrid dependency-based sentiment analysis framework and deep neural network based multimodal fusion. Extensive experimental results have proven the effectiveness of the proposed approaches as compared to state-of-the-art approaches including deep neural networks.","2019","2021-07-20 15:23:38","2021-07-20 15:23:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Stirling (United Kingdom)","","","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Towards addressing these limitations, this paper describes an architecture inspired by research in cognitive systems that integrates commonsense logical reasoning with deep learning algorithms. In the context of answering explanatory questions about scenes and the underlying classification problems, the architecture uses deep networks for processing images and for generating answers to queries. Between these deep networks, it embeds components for non-monotonic logical reasoning with incomplete commonsense domain knowledge and for decision tree induction. Experimental results show that this architecture outperforms an architecture based only on deep networks when the training dataset is small, provides comparable performance on larger datasets, and provides intuitive answers to explanatory questions.","2018","2021-07-20 15:23:38","2021-07-20 15:23:38","","11–19","","","","","","","HAI '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Southampton, United Kingdom","","","","deep networks; explainable visual query answering; non-monotonic logical reasoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our neural-symbolic visual question answering (NS-VQA) system first recovers a structural scene representation from the image and a program trace from the question. It then executes the program on the scene representation to obtain an answer. Incorporating symbolic structure as prior knowledge offers three unique advantages. First, executing programs on a symbolic space is more robust to long program traces; our model can solve complex reasoning tasks better, achieving an accuracy of 99.8% on the CLEVR dataset. Second, the model is more data- and memory-efficient: it performs well after learning on a small number of training data; it can also encode an image into a compact representation, requiring less storage than existing methods for offline question answering.

Concretely, we define a deep learning method for relation-based argument mining to extract argumentative relations of attack and support. We then use this method for determining whether news articles support tweets, a useful task in fact-checking settings, where determining agreement toward a statement is a useful step toward determining its truthfulness. Furthermore, we use our method for extracting bipolar argumentation frameworks from reviews to help detect whether they are deceptive. We show experimentally that our method performs well in both settings.

In this paper, we propose a novel Neuro-symbolic approach that combines neural networks with constraint-based reasoning. Specifically, our method first uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to perform syntax repairs for the buggy programs; subsequently, the resulting syntactically-fixed programs are repaired using constraint-based techniques to ensure functional correctness. The RNNs are trained using a corpus of syntactically correct submissions for a given programming assignment, and are then queried to fix syntax errors in an incorrect programming submission by replacing or inserting the predicted tokens at the error location. We evaluate our technique on a dataset comprising of over 14,500 student submissions with syntax errors. Our method is able to repair syntax errors in 60% (8689) of submissions, and finds functionally correct repairs for 23.8% (3455) submissions.","2018","2021-07-20 15:23:39","2021-07-20 15:23:39","","60–70","","","","","","","ICSE '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Gothenburg, Sweden","","","","automated feedback generation; neural guided search; neural program correction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To match such requirement, spatial entities are represented as a graph, whose number of nodes is equal to the amount of unique values of the spatial attribute elements. Then, the graph nodes are linearly arranged to formulate a partially ordered set; and thus be included in the Fuzzy Lattice classifier. The overall problem of incorporating spatial attributes in FLR was deduced to a Minimum Linear Arrangement problem.

Traditional unimodal biometric systems do not fully meet the aforementioned requirements making them vulnerable and susceptible to different types of attacks. In response to that, modern biometric systems combine multiple biometric modalities at different fusion levels, such as sensor, feature, score and decision level. The fused score is decisive to classify an unknown user as a genuine or impostor. In this paper, we describe a new biometric fusion framework based on Subjective Logic (SL); a type of probabilistic logic that explicitly takes uncertainty and trust into consideration. We principally evaluate our proposed fusion framework using two modalities, namely iris and fingerprint. Furethermore, the individual scores obtained from various comparators are combined at score level by applying four score fusion approaches (minimum score, maximum score, simple sum, and subjective logic) and three score normalization techniques (min-max, z-score, hyperbolic tangent).

However, it is known that given enough resources, an attacker will successfully reverse engineer an obfuscated program. Therefore, an open challenge for software obfuscation is estimating the time an obfuscated program is able to withstand a given reverse engineering attack. This paper proposes a general framework for choosing the most relevant software features to estimate the effort of automated attacks. Our framework uses these software features to build regression models that can predict the resilience of different software protection transformations against automated attacks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we instantiate it in a case-study about predicting the time needed to deobfuscate a set of C programs, using an attack based on symbolic execution. To train regression models our system requires a large set of programs as input. We have therefore implemented a code generator that can generate large numbers of arbitrarily complex random C functions. Our results show that features such as the number of community structures in the graph-representation of symbolic path-constraints, are far more relevant for predicting deobfuscation time than other features generally used to measure the potency of control-flow obfuscation (e.g. cyclomatic complexity). Our best model is able to predict the number of seconds of symbolic execution-based deobfuscation attacks with over 90% accuracy for 80% of the programs in our dataset, which also includes several realistic hash functions.","2017","2021-07-20 15:23:39","2021-07-20 15:23:39","","661–678","","","","","","","SEC'17","","","","USENIX Association","USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Vancouver, BC, Canada","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenge is that semantic representations must be computed in a syntax-directed manner, because semantics is compositional, but at the same time, small changes in syntax can lead to very large changes in semantics, which can be difficult for continuous neural architectures.

A distributed executor can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, but is weak in terms of execution efficiency and explicit interpretability. A symbolic executor is efficient in execution, but is very difficult to train especially at initial stages.

Many important problem areas are both richly structured and large scale, from social and biological networks, to knowledge graphs and the Web, to images, video, and natural language. In this paper, we introduce two new formalisms for modeling structured data, and show that they can both capture rich structure and scale to big data. The first, hingeloss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs), is a new kind of probabilistic graphical model that generalizes different approaches to convex inference. We unite three approaches from the randomized algorithms, probabilistic graphical models, and fuzzy logic communities, showing that all three lead to the same inference objective. We then define HL-MRFs by generalizing this unified objective. The second new formalism, probabilistic soft logic (PSL), is a probabilistic programming language that makes HL-MRFs easy to define using a syntax based on first-order logic. We introduce an algorithm for inferring most-probable variable assignments (MAP inference) that is much more scalable than general-purpose convex optimization methods, because it uses message passing to take advantage of sparse dependency structures. We then show how to learn the parameters of HL-MRFs. The learned HL-MRFs are as accurate as analogous discrete models, but much more scalable. Together, these algorithms enable HL-MRFs and PSL to model rich, structured data at scales not previously possible.","2017-01","2021-07-20 15:23:39","2021-07-20 15:23:39","","3846–3912","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: JMLR.org","","","","statistical relational learning; probabilistic graphical models; structured prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Instead of relying on the classical constraint solving, in MLB, the feasibility problems of the path conditions are transformed into optimization problems, by minimizing some dissatisfaction degree. The optimization problems are then handled by the underlying optimization solver through machine learning guided sampling and validation.

A characteristic of neurules is that in contrast to other hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, they retain the naturalness and modularity of symbolic rules. Neurules are produced from available symbolic rules that represent general knowledge, which however do not completely cover the domain. We use health condition, age, gender, annual income, profession, insurance type and primary life insurance benefit as assessment parameters used in rule conditions. The integration of neurules and cases employs different types of indices for the cases according to different roles they play in neurule-based reasoning. This results in its accuracy improvement.

While we depend on the flawless functioning of such intelligent systems, and often take their behavioral correctness and safety for granted, it is notoriously difficult to generate test cases that expose subtle errors in the implementations of machine learning algorithms. Hence, the validation of intelligent systems is usually achieved by studying their behavior on representative data sets, using methods such as cross-validation and bootstrapping.In this paper, we present a new testing methodology for studying the correctness of intelligent systems. Our approach uses symbolic decision procedures coupled with statistical hypothesis testing to validate machine learning algorithms. We show how we have employed our technique to successfully identify subtle bugs (such as bit flips) in implementations of the k-means algorithm. Such errors are not readily detected by standard validation methods such as randomized testing.

We test time warping SAX with the BoP representation on 12 benchmark datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification/Clustering Collection.

However, scaling-up inference in Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) is extremely challenging. Standard graphical model inference algorithms operate on the propositional Markov network obtained by grounding the MLN and do not scale well as the number of objects in the realworld domain increases. On the other hand, algorithms which perform inference directly at the first-order level, namely lifted inference algorithms, although more scalable than propositional algorithms, require the MLN to have specific symmetric structure. Worse still, evidence breaks symmetries, and the performance of lifted inference is the same as propositional inference (or sometimes worse, due to overhead). In this paper, we propose a general method for solving this ""evidence"" problem. The main idea in our method is to approximate the given MLN having, say, n objects by an MLN having k objects such that k &lt; &lt; n and the results obtained by running potentially much faster inference on the smaller MLN are as close as possible to the ones obtained by running inference on the larger MLN. We achieve this by finding clusters of ""similar"" groundings using standard clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means), and replacing all groundings in the cluster by their cluster center. To this end, we develop a novel distance (or similarity) function for measuring the similarity between two groundings, based on the evidence presented to the MLN. We evaluated our approach on many different benchmark MLNs utilizing various clustering and inference algorithms. Our experiments clearly show the generality and scalability of our approach.","2014","2021-07-20 15:23:40","2021-07-20 15:23:40","","258–273","","","","","","","ECMLPKDD'14","","","","Springer-Verlag","Berlin, Heidelberg","","","","","","","","event-place: Nancy, France","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This definition covers first-order logical inference or probabilistic inference. It also includes much simpler manipulations commonly used to build large learning systems. For instance, we can build an optical character recognition system by first training a character segmenter, an isolated character recognizer, and a language model, using appropriate labelled training sets. Adequately concatenating these modules and fine tuning the resulting system can be viewed as an algebraic operation in a space of models. The resulting model answers a new question, that is, converting the image of a text page into a computer readable text.This observation suggests a conceptual continuity between algebraically rich inference systems, such as logical or probabilistic inference, and simple manipulations, such as the mere concatenation of trainable learning systems. Therefore, instead of trying to bridge the gap between machine learning systems and sophisticated ""all-purpose"" inference mechanisms, we can instead algebraically enrich the set of manipulations applicable to training systems, and build reasoning capabilities from the ground up.","2014-02","2021-07-20 15:23:41","2021-07-20 15:23:41","","133–149","","2","94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: USA Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers","","","","Machine learning; Reasoning; Recursive networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is achieved by representing constraints as propositional formulae and solving the associated constraint satisfaction problem. We present a variety of such constraints: pruning, input-output, functional (arithmetic), and variable splitting. NrSample is also capable of detecting search space exhaustion, leading to further speedups in clause induction and optimality. We benchmark NrSample against enumeration search (Aleph's default) and Progol's A* search in the context of program synthesis. The results show that, on large program synthesis problems, NrSample induces between 1 and 1358 times faster than enumeration (236 times faster on average), always with similar or better accuracy. Compared to Progol A*, NrSample is 18 times faster on average with similar or better accuracy except for two problems: one in which Progol A* substantially sacrificed accuracy to induce faster, and one in which Progol A* was a clear winner. Functional constraints provide a speedup of up to 53 times (21 times on average) with similar or better accuracy. We also benchmark using a few concept learning (non-program synthesis) problems.

One class of approaches involves integrating subsymbolic and symbolic systems, but this raises the question of how to effectively translate between the very different languages involved. In the approach described here, a frequent subtree mining algorithm is used to identify recurrent patterns in the state of a hierarchical deep learning system (DeSTIN) that is exposed to visual stimuli. The relationships between state-subtrees and percepts are then input to a probabilistic logic system (OpenCog's Probabilistic Logic Networks), which conducts uncertain inferences using them as axioms. The core conceptual idea is to use patterns in the states inferred by a perceptual hierarchy, as inputs to an uncertain logic system. Simple illustrative examples are presented based on the presentation of images of typed letters to DeSTIN. This work forms a component of a larger project to integrate perceptual, motoric and cognitive processing within the integrative OpenCog cognitive architecture.","2013","2021-07-20 15:23:41","2021-07-20 15:23:41","","40–49","","","","","","","AGI'13","","","","Springer-Verlag","Berlin, Heidelberg","","","","","","","","event-place: Beijing, China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper describes multi-modal symbolic regression (MMSR): a learning algorithm to construct non-linear symbolic representations of discrete dynamical systems with continuous mappings from unlabeled, time-series data. MMSR consists of two subalgorithms–clustered symbolic regression, a method to simultaneously identify distinct behaviors while formulating their mathematical expressions, and transition modeling, an algorithm to infer symbolic inequalities that describe binary classification boundaries. These subalgorithms are combined to infer hybrid dynamical systems as a collection of apt, mathematical expressions.

The reviews are automatically clustered into two groups that should contain either positive or negative reviews.

The assignment of a review into a certain cluster is based on its properties, i.e., on the words that appeared in the review. Thus, words appearing in incorrectly categorized reviews were analyzed. It was found that words that are important from the correct classification viewpoint (and thus bearing some sentiment) are often similarly important as the words in a different set than expected, therefore do not take effect as misleading information unlike words that are much more or quite insignificant.","2012","2021-07-20 15:23:41","2021-07-20 15:23:41","","265–270","","","","","","","SYNASC '12","","","","IEEE Computer Society","USA","","","","","","","","","","","","cluster mining; customer opinion; incorrect categorization; similarity; textual data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Usually, the weight of a formula cannot be related to the probability of the formula without taking into account the weights of the other formulas. In general, this is not an issue, since the weights are learned from training data. However, in many domains (e.g. healthcare, dependable systems, etc.), only little or no training data may be available, but one has access to a domain expert whose knowledge is available in the form of subjective probabilities. Within the framework of Bayesian statistics, we present a formalism for using a domain expert's knowledge for weight learning. Our approach defines priors that are different from and more general than previously used Gaussian priors over weights. We show how one can learn weights in an MLN by combining subjective probabilities and training data, without requiring that the domain expert provides consistent knowledge. Additionally, we also provide a formalism for capturing conditional subjective probabilities, which are often easier to obtain and more reliable than non-conditional probabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by extensive experiments in a domain that models failure dependencies in a cyber-physical system. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantages of using our proposed prior over that of using non-zero mean Gaussian priors in a commonly cited social network MLN testbed.","2012","2021-07-20 15:23:42","2021-07-20 15:23:42","","90–105","","","","","","","ECMLPKDD'12","","","","Springer-Verlag","Berlin, Heidelberg","","","","","","","","event-place: Bristol, UK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The power of our binding mechanism is demonstrated on unification problems: as neurons are dynamically allocated from a pool, most generally unified structures emerge at equilibrium. The network's size is O(n·k), where n is the size of the retrieved FOL structures and k is the size of the KB. The mechanism is fault-tolerant, as no fatal failures occur when random units fail.

Deductive reasoning is based on a symbolic representation and derives new statements from logical axioms. Finally, machine learning can both support information extraction by deriving symbolic representations from sensory data, e.g., via classification, and can support deductive reasoning by exploiting regularities in structured data. In this paper we combine all three methods to exploit the available information in a modular way, by which we mean that each approach, i.e., information extraction, deductive reasoning, machine learning, can be optimized independently to be combined in an overall system.

The available prior knowledge imposes a set of constraints among the function values. In particular, we consider background knowledge expressed as FOL clauses, whose predicates correspond to the functions and whose variables range over the nodes of the graph.

The core notion is to cause the deep learning vision system to utilize imprecise rather than single-point probabilities, and use local feature detection and symbolic cognition to affect the confidence associated with particular imprecise probabilities, thus modulating the amount of credence the deep learning system places on various observations and guiding its pattern recognition/formation activity. The potential application to the hybridization of the DeSTIN, SIFT and OpenCog systems is described in moderate detail. The underlying ideas are even more broadly applicable, to any computer vision approach with a significant probabilistic component which satisfies certain broad criteria.","2011","2021-07-20 15:23:42","2021-07-20 15:23:42","","346–350","","","","","","","AGI'11","","","","Springer-Verlag","Berlin, Heidelberg","","","","","","","","event-place: Mountain View, CA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a novel learning scheme based on the network wide collected experience is proposed targeting the enhancement of network elements' decision making engine. The algorithm employs a fuzzy logic inference engine in order to enable self-managed network elements to identify faults or optimization opportunities. The fuzzy logic engine is periodically updated through the use of two well known data mining techniques, namely k-Means and k-Nearest Neighbor. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in the context of a load identification problem.

However, such integration may lead to a better understanding, use and construction of more realistic models. Unfortunately, existing models are either oversimplified or require much processing time, which is unsuitable for online learning and reasoning. Currently, controlled environments like training simulators do not effectively integrate learning and reasoning. In particular, higher-order concepts and cognitive abilities have many unknown temporal relations with the data, making it impossible to represent such relationships by hand. We introduce a novel cognitive agent model and architecture for online learning and reasoning that seeks to effectively represent, learn and reason in complex training environments. The agent architecture of the model combines neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation. It is capable of learning new hypotheses from observed data, and infer new beliefs based on these hypotheses. Furthermore, it deals with uncertainty and errors in the data using a Bayesian inference model. The validation of the model on real-time simulations and the results presented here indicate the promise of the approach when performing online learning and reasoning in real-world scenarios, with possible applications in a range of areas.","2011","2021-07-20 15:23:42","2021-07-20 15:23:42","","1653–1658","","","","","","","IJCAI'11","","","","AAAI Press","","","","","","","","","event-place: Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interval type-2 fuzzy controllers can outperform conventional type-1 fuzzy controllers when the problem has a high degree of uncertainty. However, designing interval type-2 fuzzy controllers is more difficult because there are more parameters involved. In this paper, interval type-2 fuzzy systems are approximated with the average of two type-1 fuzzy systems, which has been shown to give good results in control if the type-1 fuzzy systems can be obtained appropriately. An evolutionary algorithm is applied to find the optimal interval type-2 fuzzy system as mentioned above. The human evolutionary model is applied for optimizing the interval type-2 fuzzy controller for a particular non-linear plant and results are compared against an optimal type-1 fuzzy controller. A comparative study of simulation results of the type-2 and type-1 fuzzy controllers, under different noise levels, is also presented.

This step is of major importance in the QA process, since it is the basis of several key decisions. For instance, classification helps reducing the number of possible answer candidates, as only answers matching the question category should be taken into account. This paper presents and evaluates a rule-based question classifier that partially founds its performance in the detection of the question headword and in its mapping into the target category through the use of WordNet.

Empirical results show that bidirectional probabilistic reasoning can lead to more efficient and accurate planning in comparison to pure forward reasoning.","2010","2021-07-20 15:23:43","2021-07-20 15:23:43","","583–590","","","","","","","ICML'10","","","","Omnipress","Madison, WI, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Haifa, Israel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current MLN structure learners can only learn short clauses (4-5 literals) due to extreme computational costs, and thus are unable to represent complex regularities in data. To address this problem, we present LSM, the first MLN structure learner capable of efficiently and accurately learning long clauses. LSM is based on the observation that relational data typically contains patterns that are variations of the same structural motifs. By constraining the search for clauses to occur within motifs, LSM can greatly speed up the search and thereby reduce the cost of finding long clauses. LSM uses random walks to identify densely connected objects in data, and groups them and their associated relations into a motif. Our experiments on three real-world datasets show that our approach is 2-5 orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art ones, while achieving the same or better predictive performance.","2010","2021-07-20 15:23:43","2021-07-20 15:23:43","","551–558","","","","","","","ICML'10","","","","Omnipress","Madison, WI, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Haifa, Israel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to guide the animation of the model, we rely on the use of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) of the model that is built using a well-known machine learning algorithm, that considers a complex model as a black-box component, whose behavior is inferred. Since the DFA obtained in this way may be an over-approximation and, thus, admit traces that were not admitted on the original model, this abstraction is refined using counter-examples made of unfeasible traces. The computation of counter-examples is performed using a systematic coverage of the DFA states and transitions, producing test sequences that are replayed on the model, providing either test cases for offline testing, or counter-examples that aim at refining the abstraction.","2010","2021-07-20 15:23:43","2021-07-20 15:23:43","","355–360","","","","","","","ICSTW '10","","","","IEEE Computer Society","USA","","","","","","","","","","","","machine learning; abstraction refinement; constraint solving; symbolic animation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"XQEMXTB3","thesis","2010","Gong, Liuling","Machine Learning for Signal Processing: Geometry, Kernels, and Symbolic Sequences","","","","","","Machine Learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criteria using example data or past experience. There are many successful applications of machine learning in various domains, e.g., speech and handwriting recognition, customer behavior study. The kernel trick, by mapping the non-linear problem from the input space to a new space (called the feature space) through a non-linear transformation, is applicable to both regression and classification/clustering problems. In this thesis, we focus on the problems of regression and classification/clustering based on kernel methods. A unified approach of kernel density estimation, namely the Space Kernel Analysis (SKA) is proposed. The foundation of SKA is based on the definition of space kernel which characterizes a space-dependent similarity between two vectors. It is a generalization of the classical kernel which operates in the feature space on pairwise vectors. The properties of the SKA are analyzed and the relationships between the SKA and several other kernel density estimation techniques are examined. The problem of learning from high-dimensional noisy data is especially studied. A new learning approach based on projections onto multi-dimensional ellipsoids (POME) is introduced, which is applicable to unsupervised clustering, semi-supervised clustering and classification in high-dimensional noisy data. The performances of POME-based algorithms are tested and compared with other well-known algorithms in classification and clustering. While the distance between any two points in a numeric space can be directly computed by the kernel function, the metric space of the symbolic data is hard to define. The similarity metric on strings, namely the string kernel, is an essence issue in text mining and has various applications, e.g., text categorization and protein classification. We define the string kernel as the function that measures the similarity between two strings. According to whether the kernel is decomposable as the inner product of two feature vectors, the string kernel falls into two categories. Different string kernels are analyzed and the consistency properties between them are studied.","2010","2021-07-20 15:23:44","2021-07-20 15:23:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Illinois at Chicago","USA","","","PhD Thesis","","","","","ISBN: 9781124499956","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
