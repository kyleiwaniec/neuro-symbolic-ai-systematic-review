abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new technique based on program synthesis for extracting
information from webpages. Given a natural language query and a few labeled webpages,
our method synthesizes a program that can be used to extract similar types of information
from other unlabeled webpages. To handle websites with diverse structure, our approach
employs a neurosymbolic DSL that incorporates both neural NLP models as well as standard
language constructs for tree navigation and string manipulation. We also propose an
optimal synthesis algorithm that generates all DSL programs that achieve optimal F1
score on the training examples. Our synthesis technique is compositional, prunes the
search space by exploiting a monotonicity property of the DSL, and uses transductive
learning to select programs with good generalization power. We have implemented these
ideas in a new tool called WebQA and evaluate it on 25 different tasks across multiple
domains. Our experiments show that WebQA significantly outperforms existing tools
such as state-of-the-art question answering models and wrapper induction systems.},

abstract = {Logic locking is a prominent technique to protect the integrity of hardware designs
throughout the integrated circuit design and fabrication flow. However, in recent
years, the security of locking schemes has been thoroughly challenged by the introduction
of various deobfuscation attacks. As in most research branches, deep learning is being
introduced in the domain of logic locking as well. Therefore, in this article we present
SnapShot, a novel attack on logic locking that is the first of its kind to utilize
artificial neural networks to directly predict a key bit value from a locked synthesized
gate-level netlist without using a golden reference. Hereby, the attack uses a simpler
yet more flexible learning model compared to existing work. Two different approaches
are evaluated. The first approach is based on a simple feedforward fully connected
neural network. The second approach utilizes genetic algorithms to evolve more complex
convolutional neural network architectures specialized for the given task. The attack
flow offers a generic and customizable framework for attacking locking schemes using
machine learning techniques. We perform an extensive evaluation of SnapShot for two
realistic attack scenarios, comprising both reference combinational and sequential
benchmark circuits as well as silicon-proven RISC-V core modules. The evaluation results
show that SnapShot achieves an average key prediction accuracy of 82.60% for the selected
attack scenario, with a significant performance increase of 10.49 percentage points
compared to the state of the art. Moreover, SnapShot outperforms the existing technique
on all evaluated benchmarks. The results indicate that the security foundation of
common logic locking schemes is built on questionable assumptions. Based on the lessons
learned, we discuss the vulnerabilities and potentials of logic locking uncovered
by SnapShot. The conclusions offer insights into the challenges of designing future
logic locking schemes that are resilient to machine learning attacks.},

can be integrated, using neuro-symbolic algorithms, to the machine learning-based
conversational system, to improve its run-time accuracy and to enable tools to support
curatorial tasks. Those results point towards new ways of designing development tools
which explore an integrated use of code and documentation by machines.},

task with wide range of enterprise applications. Wide range of natural language understanding

This requires effective models with robust relational reasoning capabilities to answer

effective reasoning models. This paper proposes a modified transformer architecture

highlights the relational significance of input signals is considered as well. The
result from this study shows performance gain as compared to its counterpart the transformer

abstract = {Recent research explores incorporating knowledge graphs (KG) into e-commerce recommender
systems, not only to achieve better recommendation performance, but more importantly
to generate explanations of why particular decisions are made. This can be achieved
by explicit KG reasoning, where a model starts from a user node, sequentially determines
the next step, and walks towards an item node of potential interest to the user. However,
this is challenging due to the huge search space, unknown destination, and sparse
signals over the KG, so informative and effective guidance is needed to achieve a
satisfactory recommendation quality. To this end, we propose a CoArse-to-FinE neural
symbolic reasoning approach (CAFE). It first generates user profiles as coarse sketches
of user behaviors, which subsequently guide a path-finding process to derive reasoning
paths for recommendations as fine-grained predictions. User profiles can capture prominent
user behaviors from the history, and provide valuable signals about which kinds of
path patterns are more likely to lead to potential items of interest for the user.
To better exploit the user profiles, an improved path-finding algorithm called Profile-guided
Path Reasoning (PPR) is also developed, which leverages an inventory of neural symbolic
reasoning modules to effectively and efficiently find a batch of paths over a large-scale
KG. We extensively experiment on four real-world benchmarks and observe substantial
gains in the recommendation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

Computing, and Low Power Design into a strategy to optimize logic at the synthesis
level. We utilize advances in deep learning to guide an approximate logic synthesis
engine to minimize the dynamic power consumption of a given digital CMOS circuit,
subject to a predetermined error rate at the primary outputs. Our framework, Deep-PowerX1,
focuses on replacing or removing gates on a technology-mapped network and uses a Deep
Neural Network (DNN) to predict error rates at primary outputs of the circuit when
a specific part of the netlist is approximated. The primary goal of Deep-PowerX is
to reduce the dynamic power whereas area reduction serves as a secondary objective.
Using the said DNN, Deep-PowerX is able to reduce the exponential time complexity
of standard approximate logic synthesis to linear time. Experiments are done on numerous
open source benchmark circuits. Results show significant reduction in power and area
by up to 1.47\texttimes{} and 1.43\texttimes{} compared to exact solutions and by up to 22% and 27% compared
to state-of-the-art approximate logic synthesis tools while having orders of magnitudes

graphs to accelerate execution and to deploy applications on various devices. Modern
deep learning frameworks construct computation graphs dynamically. This gives rise
to the problem of inferring types of dynamic computation graphs. Two approaches are
known. One of them is a dynamic approach that constructs the computation graph from
the execution trace of an actual input. While this approach is straightforward, the
results of the shape inference will consist of only concrete values and is often difficult
for users to interpret. The other one performs static analysis over the source program.
This method can produce symbolic shape inference results but suffers from the dynamic
nature of the host programming language Python.  In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for type, shape, and symbolic shape inference of dynamic computation graphs
as a mixture of the above two methods. We present results of applying our prototype

a common application being to predict and categorize user behavior. However, ML models
often suffer from only being exposed to biased data – for instance, a search ranking
model that uses clicks to determine how to rank will suffer from position bias. The
difficulty arises due to user feedback only being observed for one treatment and not
existing counterfactually for other potential treatments. In this work, we discuss
a real-world situation in which a binary classification model is used in production
in order to make decisions about how to treat users. We introduce the model and discuss
the limitations of our modeling approach. We show that by using unit selection criterion
we can do a better job classifying users. Following, we propose a causal modeling
method in which we can take the existing data and use it to derive bounds that can
be used to modify the objective function in order to incorporate causal learning into
our training process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a real-world
setting. },

abstract = {Manufacturing automation is a double-edged sword, on one hand, it increases productivity
of production system, cost reduction, reliability, etc. However, on the other hand
it increases the complexity of the system. This has led to the need of efficient solutions
such as artificial techniques. Data and experiences are extracted from experts that
usually rely on common sense when they solve problems. They also use vague and ambiguous
terms. However, knowledge engineer would have difficulties providing a computer with
the same level of understanding. To resolve this situation, this article proposed
fuzzy logic to know how the authors can represent expert knowledge that uses fuzzy
terms in supervising complex industrial processes as a first step. As a second step,
adopting one of the powerful techniques of machine learning, which is Support Vector
Machine (SVM), the authors want to classify data to determine state of the supervision
system and learn how to supervise the process preserving habitual linguistic used
by operators.},

abstract = {Perception and reasoning are two representative abilities of intelligence that are
integrated seamlessly during human problem-solving processes. In the area of artificial
intelligence (AI), the two abilities are usually realised by machine learning and
logic programming, respectively. However, the two categories of techniques were developed
separately throughout most of the history of AI. In this paper, we present the abductive
learning targeted at unifying the two AI paradigms in a mutually beneficial way, where
the machine learning model learns to perceive primitive logic facts from data, while
logical reasoning can exploit symbolic domain knowledge and correct the wrongly perceived
facts for improving the machine learning models. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach
to optimise the machine learning model and the logical reasoning model jointly. We
demonstrate that by using abductive learning, machines can learn to recognise numbers
and resolve unknown mathematical operations simultaneously from images of simple hand-written
equations. Moreover, the learned models can be generalised to longer equations and
adapted to different tasks, which is beyond the capability of state-of-the-art deep
learning models.},

of network lifetime by considering the fuzzy logic approach which is used to elect

abstract = {In the era of digital media, e-commerce and social networks, websites allow users
to share opinions and feedback about products and services. Customers can make informed
decisions by reading the experiences of other users. In addition, customer feedback
can be used by the organizations to further improve the offered services. However,
the quintillion bytes of data generated per day in different languages such as Persian
consisting of user feedback cannot be manually read and analyzed by an individual
or an organization, for gauging public opinion. Sentiment analysis is an automated
process of computationally understanding and classifying subjective information in
multi disciplinary fields such as products, movies, news, public opinion etc. In this
thesis, we focus on developing novel methods for Persian text based sentiment analysis.
We exploit the developed text-based methods to improve multimodal polarity detection.
Specifically, we develop a novel hybrid framework that integrates dependency-based
rules and deep neural networks for detecting polarity in Persian natural language
sentences. In addition, we develop a Persian multimodal sentiment analysis framework
that integrates audio, visual and textual cues to computationally understand and harvest
sentiments from videos posted on social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook.
Specifically, a first of its kind, multimodal Persian sentiment analysis dataset is
developed, which is then used evaluate the proposed multimodal framework that exploits
the hybrid dependency-based sentiment analysis framework and deep neural network based
multimodal fusion. Extensive experimental results have proven the effectiveness of
the proposed approaches as compared to state-of-the-art approaches including deep
neural networks.},

networks learned from such datasets. Towards addressing these limitations, this paper
describes an architecture inspired by research in cognitive systems that integrates
commonsense logical reasoning with deep learning algorithms. In the context of answering
explanatory questions about scenes and the underlying classification problems, the
architecture uses deep networks for processing images and for generating answers to
queries. Between these deep networks, it embeds components for non-monotonic logical
reasoning with incomplete commonsense domain knowledge and for decision tree induction.
Experimental results show that this architecture outperforms an architecture based
only on deep networks when the training dataset is small, provides comparable performance
on larger datasets, and provides intuitive answers to explanatory questions.},

visual question answering (NS-VQA) system first recovers a structural scene representation
from the image and a program trace from the question. It then executes the program
on the scene representation to obtain an answer. Incorporating symbolic structure
as prior knowledge offers three unique advantages. First, executing programs on a
symbolic space is more robust to long program traces; our model can solve complex
reasoning tasks better, achieving an accuracy of 99.8% on the CLEVR dataset. Second,
the model is more data- and memory-efficient: it performs well after learning on a
small number of training data; it can also encode an image into a compact representation,
requiring less storage than existing methods for offline question answering. Third,
symbolic program execution offers full transparency to the reasoning process; we are
thus able to interpret and diagnose each execution step.},

Concretely, we define a deep learning method for relation-based argument mining to
extract argumentative relations of attack and support. We then use this method for
determining whether news articles support tweets, a useful task in fact-checking settings,
where determining agreement toward a statement is a useful step toward determining
its truthfulness. Furthermore, we use our method for extracting bipolar argumentation
frameworks from reviews to help detect whether they are deceptive. We show experimentally
that our method performs well in both settings. In particular, in the case of deception

abstract = {Encountering with a nonlinear second-order differential equation including ∈r and
μr spatial distributions, while computing the fields inside inhomogeneous media, persuaded
us to find their known distributions that give exact solutions. Similarities between
random distributions of electric properties and known functions lead us to estimate
them using three mathematical tools of artificial neural networks (ANNs), support
vector machines (SVMs) and Fuzzy Logic (FL). Assigning known functions after fitting
with minimum error to arbitrary inputs using results of machine learning networks
leads to achieve an approximate solution for the field inside materials considering
boundary conditions. A comparative study between the methods according to the complexity
of the structures as well as the accuracy and the calculation time for testing of
unforeseen inputs, including classification, prediction and regression is presented.
We examined the extracted pairs of ∈r and μr with ANN, SVM networks and FL and got
satisfactory outputs with detailed results. The application of the presented method
in zero reflection subjects is exemplified.},

applications in security, verification, and education. One application that is becoming
increasingly important is the correction of student submissions in online courses

Trees (ASTs) of programs, which are unfortunately unavailable for programs with syntax
errors. In this paper, we propose a novel Neuro-symbolic approach that combines neural
networks with constraint-based reasoning. Specifically, our method first uses a Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) to perform syntax repairs for the buggy programs; subsequently,
the resulting syntactically-fixed programs are repaired using constraint-based techniques
to ensure functional correctness. The RNNs are trained using a corpus of syntactically
correct submissions for a given programming assignment, and are then queried to fix
syntax errors in an incorrect programming submission by replacing or inserting the
predicted tokens at the error location. We evaluate our technique on a dataset comprising
of over 14,500 student submissions with syntax errors. Our method is able to repair
syntax errors in 60% (8689) of submissions, and finds functionally correct repairs
for 23.8% (3455) submissions.},

fields of dynamic programming, and its Q Neural Network (Q-NN) can map the states
of the environment to the corresponding control actions. Q learning algorithm can
reach or exceed human level in some video games. Nevertheless, the function of a neural
network is similar to a black box. When the network fails in some control tasks, the
adjustment of the network by the people is very difficult to achieve. In contrast,
due to the semantic control rules of the Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC), incorrect rules
can be artificially adjusted, however, a completely manual control rules design is
a burdensome task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new method for the FLC to
learn rules from well-trained neural networks and then fine-tune incorrect rules based
on human knowledge. Finally, we experimented with navigational task and showed that
the FLC we designed is able to accomplish the task, which achieved all of the reaching-target
goals in 100,000 tests. (all the experiments results and relative codes are available

abstract = {This work extends the Fuzzy Lattice Reasoning (FLR) Classifier to manage spatial attributes,
and spatial relationships. Specifically, we concentrate on spatial entities, as countries,
cities, or states. Lattice Theory requires the elements of a Lattice to be partially
ordered. To match such requirement, spatial entities are represented as a graph, whose
number of nodes is equal to the amount of unique values of the spatial attribute elements.
Then, the graph nodes are linearly arranged to formulate a partially ordered set;
and thus be included in the Fuzzy Lattice classifier. The overall problem of incorporating
spatial attributes in FLR was deduced to a Minimum Linear Arrangement problem. A corresponding
open-source implementation in R has been made available on CRAN repository. The proposed
method was evaluated using an open spatial dataset from the National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS). We investigated whether the addition of the spatial attribute contributed
to any improvements in classification accuracy; and how linear arrangement alternatives
may affect it. Experimental results showed that classification accuracy is above 85%
in all cases, and the use of spatial attributes resulted to an increased accuracy
of 92%. Alternative linear arrangements did not contribute significantly in improving
classification accuracy in this case study.},

performance, presentation attack detection (PAD), large population coverage, demographic
diversity, and varied deployment environment. Traditional unimodal biometric systems
do not fully meet the aforementioned requirements making them vulnerable and susceptible
to different types of attacks. In response to that, modern biometric systems combine
multiple biometric modalities at different fusion levels, such as sensor, feature,
score and decision level. The fused score is decisive to classify an unknown user
as a genuine or impostor. In this paper, we describe a new biometric fusion framework
based on Subjective Logic (SL); a type of probabilistic logic that explicitly takes
uncertainty and trust into consideration. We principally evaluate our proposed fusion
framework using two modalities, namely iris and fingerprint. Furethermore, the individual
scores obtained from various comparators are combined at score level by applying four
score fusion approaches (minimum score, maximum score, simple sum, and subjective
logic) and three score normalization techniques (min-max, z-score, hyperbolic tangent).
The experimental results show that the proposed score level fusion approach (subjective
logic) gives the best authentication accuracy even when particular biometric classifiers
give distinct comparison scores.},

isbn = {9781931971409},
publisher = {USENIX Association},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Software obfuscation transforms code such that it is more difficult to reverse engineer.
However, it is known that given enough resources, an attacker will successfully reverse
engineer an obfuscated program. Therefore, an open challenge for software obfuscation
is estimating the time an obfuscated program is able to withstand a given reverse
engineering attack. This paper proposes a general framework for choosing the most
relevant software features to estimate the effort of automated attacks. Our framework
uses these software features to build regression models that can predict the resilience
of different software protection transformations against automated attacks. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we instantiate it in a case-study about predicting
the time needed to deobfuscate a set of C programs, using an attack based on symbolic
execution. To train regression models our system requires a large set of programs
as input. We have therefore implemented a code generator that can generate large numbers
of arbitrarily complex random C functions. Our results show that features such as
the number of community structures in the graph-representation of symbolic path-constraints,
are far more relevant for predicting deobfuscation time than other features generally
used to measure the potency of control-flow obfuscation (e.g. cyclomatic complexity).
Our best model is able to predict the number of seconds of symbolic execution-based
deobfuscation attacks with over 90% accuracy for 80% of the programs in our dataset,
which also includes several realistic hash functions.},

trained to represent semantic equivalence, even of expressions that are syntactically

a syntax-directed manner, because semantics is compositional, but at the same time,
small changes in syntax can lead to very large changes in semantics, which can be
difficult for continuous neural architectures. We perform an exhaustive evaluation

abstract = {Building neural networks to query a knowledge base (a table) with natural language
is an emerging research topic in deep learning. An executor for table querying typically
requires multiple steps of execution because queries may have complicated structures.
In previous studies, researchers have developed either fully distributed executors
or symbolic executors for table querying. A distributed executor can be trained in
an end-to-end fashion, but is weak in terms of execution efficiency and explicit interpretability.
A symbolic executor is efficient in execution, but is very difficult to train especially
at initial stages. In this paper, we propose to couple distributed and symbolic execution
for natural language queries, where the symbolic executor is pretrained with the distributed
executor's intermediate execution results in a step-by-step fashion. Experiments show
that our approach significantly outperforms both distributed and symbolic executors,
exhibiting high accuracy, high learning efficiency, high execution efficiency, and
high interpretability.},

and natural language. In this paper, we introduce two new formalisms for modeling
structured data, and show that they can both capture rich structure and scale to big
data. The first, hingeloss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs), is a new kind of probabilistic
graphical model that generalizes different approaches to convex inference. We unite
three approaches from the randomized algorithms, probabilistic graphical models, and
fuzzy logic communities, showing that all three lead to the same inference objective.
We then define HL-MRFs by generalizing this unified objective. The second new formalism,
probabilistic soft logic (PSL), is a probabilistic programming language that makes
HL-MRFs easy to define using a syntax based on first-order logic. We introduce an
algorithm for inferring most-probable variable assignments (MAP inference) that is
much more scalable than general-purpose convex optimization methods, because it uses
message passing to take advantage of sparse dependency structures. We then show how
to learn the parameters of HL-MRFs. The learned HL-MRFs are as accurate as analogous
discrete models, but much more scalable. Together, these algorithms enable HL-MRFs

path conditions to guide the program traversing. However, due to the limitation of
the current constraint solvers, it is difficult to apply symbolic execution on programs
with complex path conditions, like nonlinear constraints and function calls. In this
paper, we propose a new symbolic execution tool MLB to handle such problem. Instead
of relying on the classical constraint solving, in MLB, the feasibility problems of
the path conditions are transformed into optimization problems, by minimizing some
dissatisfaction degree. The optimization problems are then handled by the underlying
optimization solver through machine learning guided sampling and validation. MLB is
implemented on the basis of Symbolic PathFinder and encodes not only the simple linear
path conditions, but also nonlinear arithmetic operations, and even black-box function
calls of library methods, into symbolic path conditions. Experiment results show that
MLB can achieve much better coverage on complex real-world programs. },

sector that concerns estimation of potential risks underlying an application, if accepted.
This task is accomplished by specialized personnel of insurance companies. Because
of recent financial crises, this task is more demanding, and intelligent computer-based
methods could be employed to assist. In this paper, we present an intelligent approach
to assessment of life insurance applications, which is based on an integration of
neurule-based with case-based reasoning. Neurules are a type of neuro-symbolic rules
that combine a symbolic production rules and a connectionist adaline unit representation.
A characteristic of neurules is that in contrast to other hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches,
they retain the naturalness and modularity of symbolic rules. Neurules are produced
from available symbolic rules that represent general knowledge, which however do not
completely cover the domain. We use health condition, age, gender, annual income,
profession, insurance type and primary life insurance benefit as assessment parameters
used in rule conditions. The integration of neurules and cases employs different types
of indices for the cases according to different roles they play in neurule-based reasoning.
This results in its accuracy improvement. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
of the approach.},

abstract = {Embedded intelligent systems ranging from tiny implantable biomedical devices to large
swarms of autonomous unmanned aerial systems are becoming pervasive in our daily lives.
While we depend on the flawless functioning of such intelligent systems, and often
take their behavioral correctness and safety for granted, it is notoriously difficult
to generate test cases that expose subtle errors in the implementations of machine
learning algorithms. Hence, the validation of intelligent systems is usually achieved
by studying their behavior on representative data sets, using methods such as cross-validation
and bootstrapping.In this paper, we present a new testing methodology for studying
the correctness of intelligent systems. Our approach uses symbolic decision procedures
coupled with statistical hypothesis testing to validate machine learning algorithms.
We show how we have employed our technique to successfully identify subtle bugs (such
as bit flips) in implementations of the k-means algorithm. Such errors are not readily
detected by standard validation methods such as randomized testing. We also use our
algorithm to analyze the robustness of a human detection algorithm built using the
OpenCV open-source computer vision library. We show that the human detection implementation
can fail to detect humans in perturbed video frames even when the perturbations are
so small that the corresponding frames look identical to the naked eye.},

abstract = {Markov Logic is a powerful representation that unifies first-order logic and probabilistic
graphical models. However, scaling-up inference in Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) is
extremely challenging. Standard graphical model inference algorithms operate on the
propositional Markov network obtained by grounding the MLN and do not scale well as
the number of objects in the realworld domain increases. On the other hand, algorithms
which perform inference directly at the first-order level, namely lifted inference
algorithms, although more scalable than propositional algorithms, require the MLN
to have specific symmetric structure. Worse still, evidence breaks symmetries, and
the performance of lifted inference is the same as propositional inference (or sometimes
worse, due to overhead). In this paper, we propose a general method for solving this
"evidence" problem. The main idea in our method is to approximate the given MLN having,
say, n objects by an MLN having k objects such that k &lt; &lt; n and the results obtained
by running potentially much faster inference on the smaller MLN are as close as possible
to the ones obtained by running inference on the larger MLN. We achieve this by finding
clusters of "similar" groundings using standard clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means),
and replacing all groundings in the cluster by their cluster center. To this end,
we develop a novel distance (or similarity) function for measuring the similarity
between two groundings, based on the evidence presented to the MLN. We evaluated our
approach on many different benchmark MLNs utilizing various clustering and inference
algorithms. Our experiments clearly show the generality and scalability of our approach.},

results suggest that functional food-webs have at least the same levels of predictive

sufficient information is available from simple feature measurements of a conjecture

be automatically learned. Selecting from a set of 5 heuristics, the learned results
are better than any single heuristic. The same results are also comparable to the
prover's own heuristic selection method, which has access to 82 heuristics including
the 5 used by our method, and which required additional human expertise to guide its
design. One version of our system is able to decline proof attempts. This achieves
a significant reduction in total time required, while at the same time causing only
a moderate reduction in the number of theorems proved. To our knowledge no earlier

abstract = {Much research in Bayesian modeling has been done to elicit a prior distribution that
incorporates domain knowledge. We present a novel and more direct approach by imposing
First-Order Logic (FOL) rules on the posterior distribution. Our approach unifies
FOL and Bayesian modeling under the regularized Bayesian framework. In addition, our
approach automatically estimates the uncertainty of FOL rules when they are produced
by humans, so that reliable rules are incorporated while unreliable ones are ignored.
We apply our approach to latent topic modeling tasks and demonstrate that by combining
FOL knowledge and Bayesian modeling, we both improve the task performance and discover
more structured latent representations in unsupervised and supervised learning.},

abstract = {We modeled the CBR technique of forensic autopsy report preparation.The CBR model
was coupled with Na\"{\i}ve Bayes learner for feature weight learning and also the outcome
prediction.Feature weight learning improves the CBR system accuracy.The outcome prediction
is improved with Na\"{\i}ve Bayes prediction. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is one of the
matured paradigms of artificial intelligence for problem solving. CBR has been applied
in many areas in the commercial sector to assist daily operations. However, CBR is
relatively new in the field of forensic science. Even though forensic personnel have
consciously used past experiences in solving new cases, the idea of applying machine
intelligence to support decision-making in forensics is still in its infancy and poses
a great challenge. This paper highlights the limitation of the methods used in forensics
compared with a CBR method in the analysis of forensic evidences. The design and development
of an Intelligent Forensic Autopsy Report System (I-AuReSys) basing on a CBR method
along with the experimental results are presented. Our system is able to extract features
by using an information extraction (IE) technique from the existing autopsy reports;
then the system analyzes the case similarities by coupling the CBR technique with
a Na\"{\i}ve Bayes learner for feature-weights learning; and finally it produces an outcome
recommendation. Our experimental results reveal that the CBR method with the implementation
of a learner is indeed a viable alternative method to the forensic methods with practical
advantages.},

abstract = {A plausible definition of "reasoning" could be "algebraically manipulating previously
acquired knowledge in order to answer a new question". This definition covers first-order
logical inference or probabilistic inference. It also includes much simpler manipulations
commonly used to build large learning systems. For instance, we can build an optical
character recognition system by first training a character segmenter, an isolated
character recognizer, and a language model, using appropriate labelled training sets.
Adequately concatenating these modules and fine tuning the resulting system can be
viewed as an algebraic operation in a space of models. The resulting model answers
a new question, that is, converting the image of a text page into a computer readable
text.This observation suggests a conceptual continuity between algebraically rich
inference systems, such as logical or probabilistic inference, and simple manipulations,
such as the mere concatenation of trainable learning systems. Therefore, instead of
trying to bridge the gap between machine learning systems and sophisticated "all-purpose"
inference mechanisms, we can instead algebraically enrich the set of manipulations
applicable to training systems, and build reasoning capabilities from the ground up.},

NrSample uses propositional logic constraints to exclude undesirable candidates from
the search. This is achieved by representing constraints as propositional formulae

such constraints: pruning, input-output, functional (arithmetic), and variable splitting.
NrSample is also capable of detecting search space exhaustion, leading to further
speedups in clause induction and optimality. We benchmark NrSample against enumeration
search (Aleph's default) and Progol's A* search in the context of program synthesis.
The results show that, on large program synthesis problems, NrSample induces between
1 and 1358 times faster than enumeration (236 times faster on average), always with
similar or better accuracy. Compared to Progol A*, NrSample is 18 times faster on
average with similar or better accuracy except for two problems: one in which Progol
A* substantially sacrificed accuracy to induce faster, and one in which Progol A*
was a clear winner. Functional constraints provide a speedup of up to 53 times (21
times on average) with similar or better accuracy. We also benchmark using a few concept
learning (non-program synthesis) problems. The results indicate that without strong
constraints, the overhead of solving constraints is not compensated for.},

relational model, in which objects are represented in a multi-layer, action-oriented
space, and actions are represented in an object-oriented space. Model learning is
based on homogeneity analysis, with extra dependency learning and decomposition of
unique object scores into different action layers. The model is evaluated on a dataset
of objects and actions in a kitchen scenario, and the experimental results illustrate
that the proposed model yields semantically reasonable interpretation of object-action
relations. The learned object-action relation model is also tested in various practical
tasks (e.g. action effect prediction, object selection), and it displays high accuracy
and robustness to noise and missing data.},

abstract = {The bridging of the gap between 1) subsymbolic pattern recognition and learning algorithms
and 2) symbolic reasoning algorithms, has been a major issue for AI since the early
days of the field. One class of approaches involves integrating subsymbolic and symbolic
systems, but this raises the question of how to effectively translate between the
very different languages involved. In the approach described here, a frequent subtree
mining algorithm is used to identify recurrent patterns in the state of a hierarchical
deep learning system (DeSTIN) that is exposed to visual stimuli. The relationships
between state-subtrees and percepts are then input to a probabilistic logic system
(OpenCog's Probabilistic Logic Networks), which conducts uncertain inferences using
them as axioms. The core conceptual idea is to use patterns in the states inferred
by a perceptual hierarchy, as inputs to an uncertain logic system. Simple illustrative
examples are presented based on the presentation of images of typed letters to DeSTIN.
This work forms a component of a larger project to integrate perceptual, motoric and
cognitive processing within the integrative OpenCog cognitive architecture.},

CBR into an existing framework for answer validation and reranking that also includes
logical answer validation and a shallow linguistic validation, using a learning-to-rank

a learning algorithm to construct non-linear symbolic representations of discrete

consists of two subalgorithms--clustered symbolic regression, a method to simultaneously
identify distinct behaviors while formulating their mathematical expressions, and
transition modeling, an algorithm to infer symbolic inequalities that describe binary
classification boundaries. These subalgorithms are combined to infer hybrid dynamical
systems as a collection of apt, mathematical expressions. MMSR is evaluated on a collection
of four synthetic data sets and outperforms other multi-modal machine learning approaches
in both accuracy and interpretability, even in the presence of noise. Furthermore,
the versatility of MMSR is demonstrated by identifying and inferring classical expressions

belongs the problem of automatic categorization. Clustering as the most common form
of unsupervised learning enables automatic grouping of unlabeled documents into subsets
called clusters. In this paper, the authors are concerned with results of clustering
of very large electronic real-world data collections containing customers' reviews
written freely, in English as a natural language. The reviews are automatically clustered
into two groups that should contain either positive or negative reviews. The paper
focuses on the analysis why certain reviews are assigned wrongly to a group containing
mostly reviews of a different class. The assignment of a review into a certain cluster
is based on its properties, i.e., on the words that appeared in the review. Thus,
words appearing in incorrectly categorized reviews were analyzed. It was found that
words that are important from the correct classification viewpoint (and thus bearing
some sentiment) are often similarly important as the words in a different set than
expected, therefore do not take effect as misleading information unlike words that
are much more or quite insignificant.},

year = {2012},
isbn = {9783642334597},
publisher = {Springer-Verlag},
address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {Markov logic is a rich language that allows one to specify a knowledge base as a set
of weighted first-order logic formulas, and to define a probability distribution over
truth assignments to ground atoms using this knowledge base. Usually, the weight of
a formula cannot be related to the probability of the formula without taking into
account the weights of the other formulas. In general, this is not an issue, since
the weights are learned from training data. However, in many domains (e.g. healthcare,
dependable systems, etc.), only little or no training data may be available, but one
has access to a domain expert whose knowledge is available in the form of subjective
probabilities. Within the framework of Bayesian statistics, we present a formalism
for using a domain expert's knowledge for weight learning. Our approach defines priors
that are different from and more general than previously used Gaussian priors over
weights. We show how one can learn weights in an MLN by combining subjective probabilities
and training data, without requiring that the domain expert provides consistent knowledge.
Additionally, we also provide a formalism for capturing conditional subjective probabilities,
which are often easier to obtain and more reliable than non-conditional probabilities.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by extensive experiments in a domain
that models failure dependencies in a cyber-physical system. Moreover, we demonstrate
the advantages of using our proposed prior over that of using non-zero mean Gaussian
priors in a commonly cited social network MLN testbed.},

FOL-like Knowledge-Base (KB). Complex structures stored in LTM are retrieved into
the WM only upon need, where they are further processed. The power of our binding
mechanism is demonstrated on unification problems: as neurons are dynamically allocated
from a pool, most generally unified structures emerge at equilibrium. The network's
size is O(n·k), where n is the size of the retrieved FOL structures and k is the size
of the KB. The mechanism is fault-tolerant, as no fatal failures occur when random
units fail. The paradigm can be used in a variety of applications, such as language
processing, reasoning and planning.},

information has been investigated to obtain a more meaningful feature space [10].
Within this work both approaches are pursued by utilizing the layered architecture
proposed by Oliver et al. [13] with the conditioned hidden Markov model (CHMM) [8].
The model is evaluated using a dataset containing sequential sub-symbolic information
(i.e. the position of body parts) and symbolic information (i.e. the detected object
the person interacts with). The results outperform the classical approach making no
use of the additional symbolic information.},

subsymbolic unstructured sensory information, e.g. in form of texts or images, and
extracts statements using various methods ranging from simple classifiers to the most
sophisticated NLP approaches. Deductive reasoning is based on a symbolic representation
and derives new statements from logical axioms. Finally, machine learning can both
support information extraction by deriving symbolic representations from sensory data,
e.g., via classification, and can support deductive reasoning by exploiting regularities
in structured data. In this paper we combine all three methods to exploit the available
information in a modular way, by which we mean that each approach, i.e., information
extraction, deductive reasoning, machine learning, can be optimized independently
to be combined in an overall system. We validate our model using data from the YAGO2

available objects, and it is required to estimate a set of functions defined on each

prior knowledge imposes a set of constraints among the function values. In particular,
we consider background knowledge expressed as FOL clauses, whose predicates correspond
to the functions and whose variables range over the nodes of the graph. These clauses
can be converted into a set of constraints that can be embedded into a graph regularization
schema. The experimental results evaluate the proposed technique on an image tagging

abstract = {Plan recognition is the task of predicting an agent's top-level plans based on its
observed actions. It is an abductive reasoning task that involves inferring cause
from effect. Most existing approaches to plan recognition use either first-order logic
or probabilistic graphical models. While the former cannot handle uncertainty, the
latter cannot handle structured representations. In order to overcome these limitations,
we develop an approach to plan recognition using Bayesian Logic Programs (BLPs), which
combine first-order logic and Bayesian networks. Since BLPs employ logical deduction
to construct the networks, they cannot be used effectively for plan recognition. Therefore,
we extend BLPs to use logical abduction to construct Bayesian networks and call the
resulting model Bayesian Abductive Logic Programs (BALPs). We learn the parameters
in BALPs using the Expectation Maximization algorithm adapted for BLPs. Finally, we
present an experimental evaluation of BALPs on three benchmark data sets and compare
its performance with the state-of-the-art for plan recognition.},

abstract = {A novel approach to computer vision is outlined, involving the use of imprecise probabilities
to connect a deep learning based hierarchical vision system with both local feature
detection based preprocessing and symbolic cognition based guidance. The core notion
is to cause the deep learning vision system to utilize imprecise rather than single-point
probabilities, and use local feature detection and symbolic cognition to affect the
confidence associated with particular imprecise probabilities, thus modulating the
amount of credence the deep learning system places on various observations and guiding
its pattern recognition/formation activity. The potential application to the hybridization
of the DeSTIN, SIFT and OpenCog systems is described in moderate detail. The underlying
ideas are even more broadly applicable, to any computer vision approach with a significant
probabilistic component which satisfies certain broad criteria.},

network management system that operates in a volatile network environment should be
able to adapt continuously its decision making mechanism through learning from the
system's behavior. In this paper, a novel learning scheme based on the network wide
collected experience is proposed targeting the enhancement of network elements' decision
making engine. The algorithm employs a fuzzy logic inference engine in order to enable
self-managed network elements to identify faults or optimization opportunities. The
fuzzy logic engine is periodically updated through the use of two well known data
mining techniques, namely k-Means and k-Nearest Neighbor. The proposed algorithm is
evaluated in the context of a load identification problem. The acquired results prove
that the proposed learning mechanism improves the deduction capability, thus promoting
our algorithm as an attractive approach for enhancing the autonomic capabilities of

Frequency Estimation (HFE), for estimating probabilities for hypothetical ‘eats' facts

The results of cross-validation tests suggest that the trophic networks with probabilities
have higher predictive accuracies compared to the networks without probabilities.
The proposed trophic networks have been examined by domain experts and comparison
with the literature shows that many of the links are corroborated by the literature.
In particular, links ascribed with high frequency are shown to correspond well with
those having multiple references in the literature. In some cases novel high frequency
links are suggested, which could be tested.},

abstract = {In real-world applications, the effective integration of learning and reasoning in
a cognitive agent model is a difficult task. However, such integration may lead to
a better understanding, use and construction of more realistic models. Unfortunately,
existing models are either oversimplified or require much processing time, which is
unsuitable for online learning and reasoning. Currently, controlled environments like
training simulators do not effectively integrate learning and reasoning. In particular,
higher-order concepts and cognitive abilities have many unknown temporal relations
with the data, making it impossible to represent such relationships by hand. We introduce
a novel cognitive agent model and architecture for online learning and reasoning that
seeks to effectively represent, learn and reason in complex training environments.
The agent architecture of the model combines neural learning with symbolic knowledge
representation. It is capable of learning new hypotheses from observed data, and infer
new beliefs based on these hypotheses. Furthermore, it deals with uncertainty and
errors in the data using a Bayesian inference model. The validation of the model on
real-time simulations and the results presented here indicate the promise of the approach
when performing online learning and reasoning in real-world scenarios, with possible
applications in a range of areas.},

conventional type-1 fuzzy controllers when the problem has a high degree of uncertainty.
However, designing interval type-2 fuzzy controllers is more difficult because there
are more parameters involved. In this paper, interval type-2 fuzzy systems are approximated
with the average of two type-1 fuzzy systems, which has been shown to give good results
in control if the type-1 fuzzy systems can be obtained appropriately. An evolutionary
algorithm is applied to find the optimal interval type-2 fuzzy system as mentioned
above. The human evolutionary model is applied for optimizing the interval type-2
fuzzy controller for a particular non-linear plant and results are compared against
an optimal type-1 fuzzy controller. A comparative study of simulation results of the
type-2 and type-1 fuzzy controllers, under different noise levels, is also presented.
Simulation results show that interval type-2 fuzzy controllers obtained with the evolutionary
algorithm outperform type-1 fuzzy controllers.},

For instance, classification helps reducing the number of possible answer candidates,
as only answers matching the question category should be taken into account. This
paper presents and evaluates a rule-based question classifier that partially founds
its performance in the detection of the question headword and in its mapping into
the target category through the use of WordNet. Moreover, we use the rule-based classifier
as a features' provider of a machine learning-based question classifier. A detailed
analysis of the rule-base contribution is presented. Despite using a very compact

generally used to regulate the DC bus voltage of shunt active power filters. In the
novel control algorithm the error signal caused by the filter losses has been computed
firstly. Then this error signal has been compensated using the fuzzy logic controller.
Simulation model of the shunt active power filter with the proposed control algorithm
has been designed using the Matlab/Simulink/Simpower and the Fuzzy Toolbox. The simulation
results show that the fuzzy logic controller compensates filter losses on the grid
and improves the power quality by reducing the total harmonic distortion (THD) of
the supply current and increasing the power factor.},

for the gate level simulation of current VLSI circuits. In this paper we combine a
dynamic load balancing algorithm and a bounded window algorithm for optimistic gate
level simulation. The bounded time window prevents the simulation from being too optimistic
and from excessive rollbacks. We utilize a machine learning algorithm (Qlearning)
to effect this combination. We introduce two dynamic load-balancing algorithms for
balancing the communication and computational load and use two learning agents to
combine these algorithms. One learning agent combines the two learning algorithms
and learns their corresponding parameters, while the second optimizes the value of
the time window. Experimental results show up to a 46% improvement in the simulation
time using this combined algorithm for several open source circuits. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time that Q-learning has been used to optimize an
optimistic gate level simulation.},

of special significance within an organisation, given streams of 'low-level' information

have been proposed in the literature. Recognition systems with a logic-based representation
of event structures, in particular, have been attracting considerable attention because,
among others, they exhibit a formal, declarative semantics, they haven proven to be
efficient and scalable, and they are supported by machine learning tools automating
the construction and refinement of event structures. In this paper we review representative
approaches of logic-based event recognition, and discuss open research issues of this
field.},

recent approach to decision-theoretic planning in relational domains uses forward
inference in dynamic Bayesian networks compiled from learned probabilistic relational

a back-propagation method for such nets in relational domains starting from a goal
state mixture distribution. We combine this with forward reasoning in a bidirectional
two-filter approach. We perform experiments in a complex 3D simulated desktop environment
with an articulated manipulator and realistic physics. Empirical results show that
bidirectional probabilistic reasoning can lead to more efficient and accurate planning

abstract = {Markov logic networks (MLNs) use first-order formulas to define features of Markov
networks. Current MLN structure learners can only learn short clauses (4-5 literals)
due to extreme computational costs, and thus are unable to represent complex regularities
in data. To address this problem, we present LSM, the first MLN structure learner
capable of efficiently and accurately learning long clauses. LSM is based on the observation
that relational data typically contains patterns that are variations of the same structural
motifs. By constraining the search for clauses to occur within motifs, LSM can greatly
speed up the search and thereby reduce the cost of finding long clauses. LSM uses
random walks to identify densely connected objects in data, and groups them and their
associated relations into a motif. Our experiments on three real-world datasets show
that our approach is 2-5 orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art ones,
while achieving the same or better predictive performance.},

on the use of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) of the model that is built using

component, whose behavior is inferred. Since the DFA obtained in this way may be an
over-approximation and, thus, admit traces that were not admitted on the original
model, this abstraction is refined using counter-examples made of unfeasible traces.
The computation of counter-examples is performed using a systematic coverage of the
DFA states and transitions, producing test sequences that are replayed on the model,
providing either test cases for offline testing, or counter-examples that aim at refining
the abstraction.},

abstract = {Machine Learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criteria using
example data or past experience. There are many successful applications of machine
learning in various domains, e.g., speech and handwriting recognition, customer behavior
study. The kernel trick, by mapping the non-linear problem from the input space to
a new space (called the feature space) through a non-linear transformation, is applicable
to both regression and classification/clustering problems. In this thesis, we focus
on the problems of regression and classification/clustering based on kernel methods.
A unified approach of kernel density estimation, namely the Space Kernel Analysis
(SKA) is proposed. The foundation of SKA is based on the definition of space kernel
which characterizes a space-dependent similarity between two vectors. It is a generalization
of the classical kernel which operates in the feature space on pairwise vectors. The
properties of the SKA are analyzed and the relationships between the SKA and several
other kernel density estimation techniques are examined. The problem of learning from
high-dimensional noisy data is especially studied. A new learning approach based on
projections onto multi-dimensional ellipsoids (POME) is introduced, which is applicable
to unsupervised clustering, semi-supervised clustering and classification in high-dimensional
noisy data. The performances of POME-based algorithms are tested and compared with
other well-known algorithms in classification and clustering. While the distance between
any two points in a numeric space can be directly computed by the kernel function,
the metric space of the symbolic data is hard to define. The similarity metric on
strings, namely the string kernel, is an essence issue in text mining and has various
applications, e.g., text categorization and protein classification. We define the
string kernel as the function that measures the similarity between two strings. According
to whether the kernel is decomposable as the inner product of two feature vectors,
the string kernel falls into two categories. Different string kernels are analyzed
and the consistency properties between them are studied.},
