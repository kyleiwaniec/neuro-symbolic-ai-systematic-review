In this work we start from simple non-relational knowledge that can be extracted from text by considering the co-occurrence of entities inside textual corpora; we show that we can easily integrate this knowledge with Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs), a neuro-symbolic model. Using LTNs it is possible to integrate axioms and facts with commonsense knowledge represented in a sub-symbolic form in one single model performing well in reasoning tasks. In spite of some current limitations, we show that results are promising. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,Computer programming languages; Commonsense knowledge; Current fields; Current limitation; Logical reasoning; Reasoning tasks; Single models; Symbolic integration; Symbolic model; Deep learning,"Bach, S.H., Broecheler, M., Huang, B., Getoor, L., Hinge-loss markov random fields and probabilistic soft logic (2017) J.

The integration of effective relational learning and reasoning methods is one of the key challenges in this direction, as neural learning and symbolic reasoning offer complementary characteristics that can benefit the development of AI systems. Relational labelling or link prediction on knowledge graphs has become one of the main problems in deep learning-based natural language processing research. Moreover, other fields which make use of neural-symbolic techniques may also benefit from such research endeavours. There have been several efforts towards the identification of missing facts from existing ones in knowledge graphs. Two lines of research try and predict knowledge relations between two entities by considering all known facts connecting them or several paths of facts connecting them. We propose a neural-symbolic graph neural network which applies learning over all the paths by feeding the model with the embedding of the minimal subset of the knowledge graph containing such paths. By learning to produce representations for entities and facts corresponding to word embeddings, we show how the model can be trained end-to-end to decode these representations and infer relations between entities in a multitask approach. Our contribution is two-fold: a neural-symbolic methodology leverages the resolution of relational inference in large graphs, and we also demonstrate that such neural-symbolic model is shown more effective than path-based approaches. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Graph neural networks; Neural-symbolic computing; Relational learning,Deep learning; Embeddings; Graph theory; Knowledge representation; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Complementary characteristics; Graph neural networks; NAtural language processing; Relational inferences; Relational learning; Relational reasoning; Symbolic reasoning; Symbolic techniques; Neural networks,"Battaglia, P., (2018) Relational Inductive Biases, Deep Learning, and Graph Networks, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Bordes, A., Usunier, N., García-Durán, A., Weston, J., Yakhnenko, O., Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data (2013) Proceedings of NIPS, pp. 2787-2795; Brockschmidt, M., Allamanis, M., Gaunt, A.L., Polozov, O., (2018) Generative Code Modeling with Graphs; Das, R., Neelakantan, A., Belanger, D., McCallum, A., Chains of reasoning over entities, relations, and text using recurrent neural networks (2017) Proceedings of EACL, pp. 132-141. , 2017; Evans, R., Grefenstette, E., Learning explanatory rules from noisy data (2018) J.

In this paper, we present a commonsense approach that utilizes an interpretable hybrid neural-symbolic system to associate extracted targets, noun chunks determined to be associated with the expressed emotion, with affective labels from a natural language expression. We leverage a pre-trained neural network that is well adapted to tree and sub-tree processing, the Dependency Tree-LSTM, to learn the affect labels of dynamic targets, determined through symbolic rules, in natural language. We find that making use of the unique properties of the recursive network provides higher accuracy and interpretability when compared to other unstructured and sequential methods for determining target-affect associations in an aspect-based sentiment analysis task. © 2019 IEEE.",affective computing; hybrid; natural language processing; neural-symbolic; recursive; sentiment,Deep learning; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Sentiment analysis; Affective Computing; hybrid; NAtural language processing; neural-symbolic; recursive; sentiment; Long short-term memory,"Lim, A., Okuno, H.G., A recipe for empathy (2015) International Journal of Social Robotics, 7 (1), pp. 35-49; Poria, S., Cambria, E., Bajpai, R., Hussain, A., A review of affective computing: From unimodal analysis to multimodal fusion (2017) Information Fusion, 37, pp. 98-125; Hochreiter, S., Schmidhuber, J., Long short-term memory (1997) Neural Computation, 9 (8), pp. 1735-1780; Cambria, E., Olsher, D., Rajagopal, D., Senticnet 3: A common and common-sense knowledge base for cognition-driven sentiment analysis (2014) Twenty-eighth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Poria, S., Cambria, E., Winterstein, G., Huang, G., Sentic patterns: Dependency-based rules for concept-level sentiment analysis (2014) Knowledge-Based Systems, 69, pp. 45-63; Sheng Tai, K., Socher, R., Manning, C.D., (2015) Improved Semantic Representations from Tree-structured Long Short-term Memory Networks; Poria, S., Chaturvedi, I., Cambria, E., Bisio, F., Sentic lda: Improving on lda with semantic similarity for aspect-based sentiment analysis (2016) Neural Networks (IJCNN), 2016 International Joint Conference on, pp. 4465-4473. , IEEE; He, R., Sun Lee, W., Tou Ng, H., Dahlmeier, D., An unsupervised neural attention model for aspect extraction (2017) Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1, pp. 388-397; Hazarika, D., Poria, S., Vij, P., Krishnamurthy, G., Cambria, E., Zimmermann, R., Modeling inter-aspect dependencies for aspect-based sentiment analysis (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, 2, pp. 266-270. , Short Papers), 2; Ma, Y., Peng, H., Cambria, E., Targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis via embedding commonsense knowledge into an attentive lstm (2018) Proceedings of AAAI; Cambria, E., Hussain, A., (2015) Sentic Computing: A Commonsense- Based Framework for Concept-level Sentiment Analysis, 1. , Springer; Buechel, S., Hahn, U., Emobank: Studying the impact of annotation perspective and representation format on dimensional emotion analysis (2017) Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2, pp. 578-585. , Short Papers; Siqueira, H., Sutherland, A., Barros, P., Kerzel, M., Magg, S., Wermter, S., Disambiguating affective stimulus associations for robot perception and dialogue (2018) IEEERAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids), pp. 433-440. , Nov; Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Papageorgiou, H., Androutsopoulos, I., Manandhar, S., Mohammad, A., Al-Ayyoub, M., De Clercq, O., Semeval-2016 task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis (2016) Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016), pp. 19-30; Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C.D., Ng, A., Potts, C., Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 1631-1642; Kim, Y., (2014) Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification; Schuff, H., Barnes, J., Mohme, J., Padó, S., Klinger, R., Annotation, modelling and analysis of fine-grained emotions on a stance and sentiment detection corpus (2017) Proceedings of the 8th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, pp. 13-23; Byrd, R.H., Lu, P., Nocedal, J., Zhu, C., A limited memory algorithm for bound constrained optimization (1995) SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 16 (5), pp. 1190-1208; Pennington, J., Socher, R., Manning, C., Glove: Global vectors for word representation (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1532-1543; Pavlenko, A., Emotions and the body in Russian and english (2002) Pragmatics & Cognition, 10 (1), pp. 207-241",,,IEEE,"International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN",14 July 2019 through 19 July 2019,,152291,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073214635

Recent work has developed the notion of a context-dependant generative policy framework capable of learning generative policy models from strings and text-based data in a tabular format. However, it is vital that unstructured contextual information can be analysed alongside tabular data, potentially at the edge of the network to enable generative policy models to be applied to more complex tasks. This paper performs a deep-dive into the field of neuralsymbolic machine learning with a view towards enabling future neural-symbolic generative policy models that are capable of analysing both structured and unstructured data, whilst providing full transparency and enabling edge of network reasoning capability. Firstly, an existing technique called DeepProbLog is investigated and applied to a policy inferencing task based on unstructured data and secondly, a recent inductive logic programming technique currently used for learning generative policy models is evaluated with respect to a policy learning task also based on unstructured data. Finally, the results of both tasks are discussed to provide a platform for future research into enabling neural-symbolic generative policy models. © 2019 IEEE.",Distributed Analytics; Generative Policy Models; Information Science; Neural-Symbolic Learning,Big data; Data Sharing; Inductive logic programming (ILP); Information science; Object oriented programming; Contextual information; Distributed Analytics; Distributed environments; Information sharing; Policy model; Reasoning capabilities; Symbolic learning; Unstructured data; Learning systems,"Verma, D., Calo, S., Chakraborty, S., Bertino, E., Williams, C., Tucker, J., Rivera, B., Generative policy model for autonomic management (2017) 2017 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence Computing, Advanced Trusted Computed, Scalable Computing Communications, Cloud Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (Smart-World/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI), pp. 1-6. , Aug; Calo, S., Manotas, I., De Mel, G., Cunnington, D., Law, M., Verma, D., Russo, A., Bertino, E., AGENP: An ASGrammar-based GENerative policy framework (2019) Policy-Based Autonomic Data Governance, pp. 3-20. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-17277-0\1, Springer, Sep; Law, M., Russo, A., Elisa, B., Krysia, B., Jorge, L., Representing and learning grammars in answer set programming (2019) AAAI; Law, M., Russo, A., Broda, K., (2015) The ILASP System for Learning Answer Set Programs, , https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/?ml1909/ILASP; Cunnington, D., Manotas, I., Law, M., De Mel, G., Calo, S., Bertino, E., Russo, A., A generative policy model for connected and autonomous vehicles (2019) 2019 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference, , Oct. due to appear; White, G., Ingham, J., Law, M., Russo, A., Using an asg based generative policy to model human rules (2019) 2019 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP), , Jun; Calo, S., Verma, D., Chakraborty, S., Bertino, E., Lupu, E., Cirincione, G., Self-generation of access control policies (2018) Proceedings of the 23Nd ACM on Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies, Ser.

One of the reasons behind this unmatched expectation is that, while a bottom-up approach is feasible for pattern recognition, reasoning and understanding often require a top-down approach. In this work, we couple sub-symbolic and symbolic AI to automatically discover conceptual primitives from text and link them to commonsense concepts and named entities in a new three-level knowledge representation for sentiment analysis. In particular, we employ recurrent neural networks to infer primitives by lexical substitution and use them for grounding common and commonsense knowledge by means of multi-dimensional scaling.

Yet, challenges remain in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) models in real-world cases, such as dependence on extensive data and trust, explainability, traceability, and interactivity. These challenges are amplified in high-risk fields, including healthcare, cyber threats, crisis response, autonomous driving, and future manufacturing. On the other hand, symbolic computing with knowledge graphs has shown significant growth in specific tasks with reliable performance. This tutorial (a) discusses the novel paradigm of knowledge-infused deep learning to synthesize neural computing with symbolic computing (b) describes different forms of knowledge and infusion methods in deep learning, and (c) discusses application-specific evaluation methods to assure explainability and reasoning using benchmark datasets and knowledge-resources. The resulting paradigm of ""knowledge-infused learning"" combines knowledge from both domain expertise and physical models. A wide variety of techniques involving shallow, semi-deep, and deep infusion will be discussed along with the corresponding intuitions, limitations, use cases, and applications.

ATPL exploits Tensor Product Representations (TPR), a structured neural-symbolic model developed in cognitive science, to integrate deep learning with explicit natural language structures and rules. The key ideas of ATPL are: 1) unsupervised learning of role-unbinding vectors of words via the TPR-based deep neural network; 2) the use of attention modules to compute TPR; and 3) the integration of TPR with typical deep learning architectures including long short-term memory and feedforward neural networks. The novelty of our approach lies in its ability to extract the grammatical structure of a sentence by using role-unbinding vectors, which are obtained in an unsupervised manner. Our ATPL approach is applied to 1) image captioning, 2) part of speech (POS) tagging, and 3) constituency parsing of a natural language sentence. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in all these three natural language processing tasks. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Information extraction uses subsymbolic unstructured sensory information, e.g. in form of texts or images, and extracts statements using various methods ranging from simple classifiers to the most sophisticated NLP approaches. Deductive reasoning is based on a symbolic representation and derives new statements from logical axioms. Finally, machine learning can both support information extraction by deriving symbolic representations from sensory data, e.g., via classification, and can support deductive reasoning by exploiting regularities in structured data. In this paper we combine all three methods to exploit the available information in a modular way, by which we mean that each approach, i.e., information extraction, deductive reasoning, machine learning, can be optimized independently to be combined in an overall system.

Historical evidence of such attacks has shown that the vast majority of malicious attempts against both physical and virtual IT systems were based or been initiated using social engineering methods. By identifying the importance of tackling efficiently cybersecurity threats and using the recent developments in machine learning, case-based reasoning and cybersecurity we propose and demonstrate a two-stage approach that detects social engineering attacks and is based on natural language processing, case-based reasoning and deep learning. Our approach can be applied in offline texts or real time environments and can identify whether a human, chatbot or offline conversation is a potential social engineering attack or not. Initially, the conversation text is parsed and checked for grammatical errors using natural language processing techniques and case-based reasoning and then deep learning is used to identify and isolate possible attacks. Our proposed method is being evaluated using both real and semi-synthetic conversation points with high accuracy results. Comparison benchmarks are also presented for comparisons in both datasets. © Copyright 2019 for this paper by its authors.",Attack Detection; Case-based Reasoning; Cybersecurity; Deep Learning; Natural Language Processing; Social Engineering,Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Attack detection; Cyber security; Grammatical errors; High-accuracy; NAtural language processing; Real-time environment; Social engineering; Two stage approach; Case based reasoning,"Sawa, Y., Bhakta, R., Harris, I.G., Hadnagy, C., Detection of social engineering attacks through natural language processing of conversations (2016) 2016 IEEE Tenth International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC), pp. 262-265. , IEEE 2016; Peng, T., Harris, I., Sawa, Y., Detecting phishing attacks using natural language processing and machine learning (2018) 2018 IEEE 12th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC), , IEEE, 2018; Mouton, F., Nottingham, A., Leenen, L., Venter, H.S., Finite state machine for the social engineering attack detection model: SEADM (2018) SAIEE Africa Research Journal, 109 (2), pp. 133-148. , (2018); Tsinganos, N., Sakellariou, G., Fouliras, P., Mavridis, I., Towards an automated recognition system for chat-based social engineering attacks in enterprise environments (2018) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, p. 53. , ACM 2018; Cialdini, R.B., The science of persuasion (2001) Scientific American, 284 (2), pp. 76-81; Manning, C., Surdeanu, M., Bauer, J., Finkel, J., Bethard, S., McClosky, D., The Stanford CoreNLP natural language processing toolkit (2014) Proceedings of 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations, pp. 55-60. , 2014; Hoeschele, M., Rogers, M., Detecting social engineering (2005) IFIP International Conference on Digital Forensics., , Springer, Boston, MA 2005; Hoeschele, M., (2006) CERIAS Tech Report 2006-15 DETECTING SOCIAL ENGINEERING., , (2006); Abid, J., Asif, K., Ghulam, Z., Nazir, M.K., Alam, S.M., Ashraf, R., MPMPA: A mitigation and prevention model for social engineering based phishing attacks on facebook (2018) 2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), pp. 5040-5048. , IEEE 2018; Bhakta, R., Harris, I.G., Semantic analysis of dialogs to detect social engineering attacks (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE 9th International Conference on Semantic Computing (IEEE ICSC 2015), , IEEE, 2015; Heartfield, R., Loukas, G., Detecting semantic social engineering attacks with the weakest link: Implementation and empirical evaluation of a human-as-a-security-sensor framework (2018) Computers & Security, 76, pp. 101-127. , (2018); Bezuidenhout, M., Mouton, F., Venter, H.S., Social engineering attack detection model: Seadm (2010) 2010 Information Security for South Africa, , IEEE, 2010; Mouton, F., Leenen, L., Venter, H.S., Social engineering attack detection model: Seadmv2 (2015) 2015 International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW), , IEEE; Nicholson, J., Coventry, L., Briggs, P., Can we fight social engineering attacks by social means?

Understanding the reasoning behind certain fake items implies inferring a lot of details about the various actors involved. We believe that the solution to this problem should be a hybrid one, combining machine learning, semantics and natural language processing. We introduce a new semantic fake news detection method built around relational features like sentiment, entities or facts extracted directly from text. Our experiments show that by adding semantic features the accuracy of fake news classification improves significantly. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Deep learning; NLP; Relation Extraction; Semantics,Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Semantics; Detection methods; NAtural language processing; Relation extraction; Relational features; Semantic features; Deep learning,"Abadi, M., (2016) Tensorflow: A System for Large-Scale Machine Learning, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08695, CoRR abs/1605.08695; Aghakhani, H., Machiry, A., Nilizadeh, S., Kruegel, C., Vigna, G., (2018) Detecting Deceptive Reviews Using Generative Adversarial Networks, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10364, CoRR abs/1805.10364; Allcott, H., Gentzkow, M., Social media and fake news in the 2016 election (2017) J.

Almost unconsciously, we provide our language utterances with temporal cues, like verb tenses, and we can hardly produce sentences without such cues. Extracting temporal cues from text, and constructing a global temporal view about the order of described events is a major challenge of automatic natural language understanding. Temporal reasoning, the process of combining different temporal cues into a coherent temporal view, plays a central role in temporal information extraction. This article presents a comprehensive survey of the research from the past decades on temporal reasoning for automatic temporal information extraction from text, providing a case study on the integration of symbolic reasoning with machine learning-based information extraction systems. © 2020 Inst.

Proposed alternatives involve translating the question and the natural language text to a logical representation and then use logical reasoning. However, this alternative falters when the size of the text gets bigger. To address this we propose an approach that does logical reasoning over premises written in natural language text. The proposed method uses recent features of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to call external NLP modules (which may be based on ML) which perform simple textual entailment. To test our approach we develop a corpus based on the life cycle questions and showed that Our system achieves up to 18% performance gain when compared to standard MCQ solvers. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).",,Life cycle; Logic programming; Natural language processing systems; Additional knowledge; Answer set programming; Logical reasoning; Logical representations; Natural language text; Question Answering; Question answering systems; Textual entailment; Artificial intelligence,"Bos, J., Wide-coverage semantic analysis with boxer (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Semantics in Text Processing, , Association for Computational Linguistics; Bowman, S.

It is considered as a challenging task with wide range of enterprise applications. Wide range of natural language understanding and reasoning tasks are found embedded within machine reading comprehension datasets. This requires effective models with robust relational reasoning capabilities to answer complex questions. Reasoning in natural language is a long-term machine-learning goal and is critically needed for building intelligent agents. However, most papers heavily depend on underlying language modeling and thus pay little to no attention on creating effective reasoning models. This paper proposes a modified transformer architecture that effectively combines soft and hard attention to create multi-perspective reasoning model capable of tackling wide range of reasoning tasks. An attention mechanism that highlights the relational significance of input signals is considered as well. The result from this study shows performance gain as compared to its counterpart the transformer network on bAbI dataset, a natural language reasoning tasks. © 2021 ACM.",machine reading comprehension;

Various attempts have been made to reduce the complexities (language understanding, feature extraction, domain recognition, intent detection, semantic slot filling and language generation) of training text-based Chatbot. While Traditional machine learning models are usually unable to be truly generic, recent advances in deep learning allow end-to-end models to be trained with large dataset. We train an open domain Chatbot end-to-end by directly mapping input tags as sequences to generate optimized output sequence tags. Our model is trained on Google Tensorflow framework running GPUs with deep neural architecture of sequence-to-sequence and attention mechanism. The interaction of the chatbot with human performed common sense reasoning. It also achieved a competitive result when quantified based on Human Performance Evaluation. However, we suggest networked reinforcement learning to incrementally update the consistency drawbacks towards achieving a generic Chatbot. © 2019 ACM.",End-to-End; Natural Language Processing; Open Domain Chatbot; Seq2Seq,Character recognition; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Large dataset; Modeling languages; Program processors; Reinforcement learning; Semantics; Chatbot; Commonsense reasoning; Conversational systems; End to end; Language understanding; Machine learning models; NAtural language processing; Seq2Seq; Natural language processing systems,"Radziwill, N., Benton, M., (2016) Evaluating Quality of Chatbots and Intelligent Conversational Agents; Wu, W., (2018) Towards Interpretable Chit-chat: Open Domain Dialogue Generation with Dialogue Acts, pp. 1-18; Turing, A.M., (1950) Computing Machinery and Intelligence; Serban, I.V., Sordoni, A., Bengio, Y., Courville, A., Pineau, J., (2014) Building End-to-End Dialogue Systems Using Generative Hierarchical Neural Network Models, pp. 3776-3783; Vinyals, O., Le, Q., (2015) A Neural Conversational Model, 37; Weizenbaum, J., Eliza-a computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine (1966) Commun.

An ideal NLU system should process a language in a way that is not exclusive to a single task or a dataset. To do so, knowledge driven generalized semantic representation for English text is utmost important for any NLU applications. Ideally, for any realistic (human like) NLU system, commonsense reasoning must be an integral part of it and goal directed answer-set-programming (ASP) is indispensable to do commonsense reasoning. Keeping all of these in mind, we have developed various NLU application ranging from visual question answering to a conversational agent. In contrast to existing purely machine learning-based methods for the same tasks, we have shown, our applications not only maintain high accuracy but also provides explanation for the answer it computes. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

Our model builds an object-based scene representation and translates sentences into executable, symbolic programs. To bridge the learning of two modules, we use a neuro-symbolic reasoning module that executes these programs on the latent scene representation. Analogical to human concept learning, the perception module learns visual concepts based on the language description of the object being referred to. Meanwhile, the learned visual concepts facilitate learning new words and parsing new sentences. We use curriculum learning to guide the searching over the large compositional space of images and language. Extensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our model on learning visual concepts, word representations, and semantic parsing of sentences. Further, our method allows easy generalization to new object attributes, compositions, language concepts, scenes and questions, and even new program domains. It also empowers applications including visual question answering and bidirectional image-text retrieval. © 7th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2019.

Spatial Role Labeling (SpRL) introduces a language-independent annotation scheme used in these applications, particularly for reasoning purposes. This paper proposes, first of all, a transfer learning method with a word embeddings-based approach for SpRL. Then, we enhance the word vectors with POS tags and CNN-based character-level representations. Finally, we propose a Residual BiLSTM CRF deep learning model to identify the spatial roles. The experimental results on two datasets: SemEval-2012 and SemEval-2013 Task 3, show that the proposed model outperforms other machine learning approaches. © 2021 The Authors.

Misinformation could potentially affect people in their daily life, and the choices they are making, be it medical, financial, or the upcoming elections. Technological solutions to identify, verify, and manage misinformation aim to combat the harmful effects of misinformation. In this research proposal, we explore the use of machine learning algorithms in combination with symbolic approaches to identify misinformation in German news texts in order to help users spot deceptive articles. Based on linguistic aspects of the text, news stories are classified as misleading or truthful. In particular, we plan to compare it to existing symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches for misinformation detection. © 2021 for this paper by its authors.",Fake news; German text; Machine learning; Misinformation,Learning algorithms; Classifieds; Daily lives; Fake news; German text; Harmful effects; Machine learning algorithms; Misinformation; Research proposals; Technological advances; Technological solution; Machine learning,"Abedalla, A., Al-Sadi, A., Abdullah, M., A closer look at fake news detection: A deep learning perspective (2019) Proceedings of the 2019 3rd In ternational Conference on Advances in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 24-28; Allcott, H., Gentzkow, M., Social media and fake news in the 2016 election (2017) Journal of economic perspectives, 31 (2), pp. 211-236; Denaux, R., Gomez-Perez, J.

Typically, for a single target concept several textual sentences are used, from which candidate concept descriptions are obtained. These candidate descriptions may have confidence values associated with them. In a final step, the candidates need to be combined into a single concept, in the easiest case by selecting a relevant subset and taking its conjunction. However, concept descriptions generated in this manner can contain false information, which is harmful when added to a formal knowledge base. In this paper, we claim that this can be improved by considering formal constraints that the target concept needs to satisfy. We first formalize a reasoning problem for the selection of relevant candidates and examine its computational complexity. Then, we show how it can be reduced to SAT, yielding a practical algorithm for its solution. Furthermore, we describe two ways to construct formal constraints, one is automatic and the other interactive. Applying this approach to the SNOMED CT ontology construction scenario, we show that the proposed framework brings a visible benefit for SNOMED CT development.

The real-time regulation and operation of large-scale power grids is a typical combination of knowledge experience-based and online analysis. In particular, the fault disposal of power grids mainly depends on the pre-compiled texts of failure scenarios, which is actually the induction of prior knowledge and summary of dispatchers. Based on the above scenarios, this paper proposes a deep learning based dispatching fault disposal robot technology. Firstly, the natural language processing technology is used to learn, understand and extract the key information of the fault preplan text, and then a fault disposal knowledge map is built on this basis. Through the reasoning and analysis of knowledge, automatic/semi-automatic disposal of faults can be achieved. © 2018 IEEE.",fault planning; intelligent scheduling; knowledge map; natural language processing; text mining,Artificial life; Data mining; Electric power transmission networks; Knowledge engineering; Natural language processing systems; Artificial intelligence technologies; Failure scenarios; Intelligent scheduling; Knowledge map; NAtural language processing; On-line analysis; Robot technology; Text mining; Deep learning,"Ding, L., He, Y., Research on domain adaption in machine translation combining domain knowledge and deep learning [j] (2017) Information Science, 35 (10), pp. 125-132; Zhao, W., Xu, L., Ran, B., Dangerous lanechange detecting model on highway based on deep learning DBN alg orithm [J] (2017) Journal of Southeast University (Natural Science Edition), 47 (4), pp. 832-838; Zhao, R., Application of artificial intelligence technology in power dispatching automation system [j] (2017) Modern Industrial Economy & Informationization; Zheng, J., Dagnino, A., An initial study of predictive machine learning analytics on large volumes of historical data for power system applications [C] (2015) IEEE International Conference on Big Data.

This paper introduces Random Multimodel Deep Learning (RMDL): a new ensemble, deep learning approach for classification. Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results across many domains. RMDL solves the problem of finding the best deep learning structure and architecture while simultaneously improving robustness and accuracy through ensembles of deep learning architectures. RDML can accept as input a variety data to include text, video, images, and symbolic. This paper describes RMDL and shows test results for image and text data including MNIST, CIFAR-10, WOS, Reuters, IMDB, and 20newsgroup. These test results show that RDML produces consistently better performance than standard methods over a broad range of data types and classification problems. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Data mining; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image classification; Supervised learning; Text classification,Classification (of information); Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image classification; Information systems; Information use; Network architecture; Supervised learning; Text processing; Complex datasets; Learning approach; Learning architectures; Learning models; Learning structure; Machine learning methods; State of the art; Text classification; Data mining,"Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G.S., Devin, M., (2016) Tensorflow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Distributed Systems, , 2016; Bengio, Y., Simard, P., Frasconi, P., Learning long-term dependencies with gradient descent is difficult (1994) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 5 (2), pp. 157-166. , 1994; Boser, B.E., Guyon, I.M., Vapnik, V.N., A training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers (1992) COLT92, pp. 144-152. , ACM; Chan, T.-H., Jia, K., Gao, S., Lu, J., Zeng, Z., Ma, Y., PCANet: A simple deep learning baseline for image classification?

Symbolic/logical-reasoning techniques have shown great success in interpreting structured data such as table extraction in webpages, custom text files, spreadsheets. The tables in PDF documents are often generated from such structured sources (text-based Word/LATEX documents, spreadsheets, webpages) but end up being unstructured. We thus explore novel combinations of deep learning and symbolic reasoning techniques to build an effective solution for PDF table extraction. We evaluate effectiveness without granting partial credit for matching part of a table (which may cause silent errors in downstream data processing). Our method achieves a 0.725 F1 score (vs. 0.339 for the state-of-the-art) on detecting correct table bounds-a much stricter metric than the common one of detecting characters within tables-in a well known public benchmark (ICDAR 2013) and a 0.404 F1 score (vs. 0.144 for the state-of-the-art) on our private benchmark with more widely varied table structures. © 2020 IEEE",,Data handling; Digital integrated circuits; E-learning; Extraction; Object recognition; Spreadsheets; Websites; Effective solution; Integrated approach; State of the art; Structured data; Symbolic analysis; Symbolic reasoning; Table structure; Unstructured data; Deep learning,"(2020) Microsoft PowerBI Forum: “Tables in PDF Files, , https://ideas.powerbi.com/forums/265200-power-biideas/suggestions/6973371-tables-in-pdf-files, PowerBI; Kavasidis, I., Palazzo, S., Spampinato, C., Pino, C., Giordano, D., Giuffrida, D., Messina, P., (2018) A Saliency-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Table and Chart Detection in Digitized Documents, , arXiv preprint; Oliveira, D.A.B., Viana, M.P., Fast cnn-based document layout analysis (2017) ICCV; Yang, X., Yumer, E., Asente, P., Kraley, M., Kifer, D., Giles, C.L., Learning to extract semantic structure from documents using multimodal fully convolutional neural networks (2017) CVPR; Li, Y., Zou, Y., Ma, J., Deeplayout: A semantic segmentation approach to page layout analysis (2018) International Conference on Intelligent Computing, , Springer; Schreiber, S., Agne, S., Wolf, I., Dengel, A., Ahmed, S., DeepDesrt: Deep learning for detection and structure recognition of tables in document images (2017) ICDAR, 1; Göbel, M., Hassan, T., Oro, E., Orsi, G., Icdar 2013 table competition (2013) ICDAR; Raza, M., Gulwani, S., Web data extraction using hybrid program synthesis: A combination of top-down and bottom-up inference (2020) SIGMOD; Le, V., Gulwani, S., Flashextract: A framework for data extraction by examples (2014) ACM SIGPLAN Notices, 49 (6); Barowy, D.W., Gulwani, S., Hart, T., Zorn, B.G., Flashrelate: Extracting relational data from semi-structured spreadsheets using examples (2015) PLDI; Raza, M., Gulwani, S., Automated data extraction using predictive program synthesis (2017) AAAI; (2020) Connect to PDF Files in Power BI Desktop, , https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-pdf, PowerBI https://aka.ms/prose-pdf; Li, M., Cui, L., Huang, S., Wei, F., Zhou, M., Li, Z., (2019) Tablebank: Table Benchmark for Image-Based Table Detection and Recognition, , arXiv preprint; Natarajan, N., Karthikeyan, A., Jain, P., Radicek, I., Rajamani, S., Gulwani, S., Gehrke, J., Programming by Rewards, p. 2020; Redmon, J., Divvala, S., Girshick, R., Farhadi, A., You only look once: Unified, real-time object detection (2016) CVPR; Neubeck, A., van Gool, L., Efficient non-maximum suppression (2006) ICPR, 3; Chen, L.-C., Papandreou, G., Schroff, F., Adam, H., (2017) Rethinking Atrous Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation, , arXiv preprint; Wang, J., Wang, H., Wang, Z., Zhu, K.Q., Understanding tables on the web (2012) International Conference on Conceptual Modeling; Zhai, Y., Liu, B., Web data extraction based on partial tree alignment (2005) WWW.

The traditional methods of text imputation include mainly classification methods based on artificial features, methods based on word similarity, and so on. Traditional methods require a large number of manual extraction features, construction rules, and the like. Deep neural networks can avoid the problems of manual extraction features in traditional machine learning methods and error accumulation caused by NLP preprocessing tools. With the good results of deep learning in the field of natural language processing, the study of natural language reasoning and textual inclusion recognition is also increasing. The same text under different tasks will focus on its focus. For the text implied recognition task, we usually focus on whether the sub-events in each text match. If we can decompose a sentence into sub-events related to it, and judge that the sub-events in the hypothetical text are contained in the sub-events of the premise text, then we can determine the implication between the two sentences. The mLSTM model achieved an accuracy of 86.1% on the SNLI corpus, which is the best level at present, but it is not effective on other small corpus. This article aims to improve the mLSTM model, establishing the mGRU model based on GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and verify the effect of the model on SNLI corpus and multiNLI corpora. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",GRU; MGRU; Textual Entailment Recognition,Artificial intelligence; Deep neural networks; Learning algorithms; Linguistics; Multimedia systems; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Classification methods; Construction rules; Error accumulation; Machine learning methods; MGRU; NAtural language processing; Preprocessing tools; Textual entailment; Character recognition,"Lai, A., Hockenmaier, J., Illinois-lh:A denotational and distributional approach to semantics (2014) SemEval, p. 329. , 2014; Jimenez, S., Duenas, G., Baquero, J., Gelbukh, A., Batiz, A.J.D., Abal, A.M., UNAL-NLP: Combining soft cardinality features for semantic textual similarity, relatedness and entailment (2014) SemEval, p. 732. , ´ 2014; Bowman, S.R., Angeli, G., Potts, C., Manning, C.D., A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference (2015) EMNLP; Cho, B.V.M., Bahdanau, D., Bengio, Y., (2014) On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder-Decoder Approaches, , arXiv preprint; Rocktäschel, T., Grefenstette, E., Hermann, K.M., Kočiský, T., Blunsom, P., Reasoning about entailment with neural attention (2016) Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations; Wang, S., Jiang, J., (2015) Learning Natural Language Inference with LSTM[J], , arXiv preprint; Grefenstette, E., Hermann, K.M., Suleyman, M., Blunsom, P., Learning to transduce with unbounded memory (2015) NIPS; Joulin, A., Mikolov, T., (2015) Inferring Algorithmic Patterns with Stack-Augmented Recurrent Nets, , arXiv preprint; Chung, J., Gulcehre, C., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., (2014) Empirical Evaluation of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling, , arXiv preprint; Kingma, D., Ba, J., ADaM: A method for stochastic optimization (2014) Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations; Williams, A., Nangia, N., Bowman, S.R., (2017) A Broad-Coverage Challenge Corpus for Sentence Understanding Through Inference, , arXiv preprint",,"Shenzhen University, College of Computer Science and Software Engineering",Association for Computing Machinery,"2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, CSAI 2018",8 December 2018 through 10 December 2018,,145664,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062787539

In this paper we exploit such advances by tailoring the ontology learning problem as a transductive reasoning task that learns to convert knowledge from natural language to a logic-based specification. More precisely, using a sample of definitory sentences generated starting by a synthetic grammar, we trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architectures to extract OWL formulae from text. In addition to the low feature engineering costs, our system shows good generalisation capabilities over the lexicon and the syntactic structure. The encouraging results obtained in the paper provide a first evidence of the potential of deep learning techniques towards long term ontology learning challenges such as improving domain independence, reducing engineering costs, and dealing with variable language forms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,Knowledge engineering; Knowledge management; Natural language processing systems; Recurrent neural networks; Syntactics; Domain independences; Feature engineerings; Logic based specification; Machine translations; NAtural language processing; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Sentiment analysis; Syntactic structure; Cost engineering,"Baader, F., Calvanese, D., McGuinness, D., Nardi, D., Patel-Schneider, P., (2003) The Description Logic Handbook: Theory, Implementation, and Applications, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bengio, Y., Ducharme, R., Vincent, P., Janvin, C., A neural probabilistic language model (2003) J.

One such kind of task is VQA (Visual Question Answering) which is inherently divided into many layers of complexities. Some questions are simple having obvious answers while some are more complex which need logical reasoning, common sense and factual knowledge. Starting simple and gradually incorporating complexity, is always a good idea in scientific research and development. At first, datasets were simpler consisting of simple question-answer pairs with images depicting simpler concepts and relatively naive VQA models were trained on them. Slowly, with time, the VQA datasets got more complicated and tangled demanding more cognitive capabilities from VQA models. This evolution pushed the VQA models to be more efficient in matching human cognitive abilities, using reasoning based on common sense and factual knowledge. In this survey, we will first discuss some of the famous datasets in the domain of VQA and then we will discuss some of the crucial advancements in the VQA architectures and what is currently being done for integrating common sense and knowledge into these models. Moreover, reasoning is very crucial for truly intelligent systems but representations in deep learning models are inherently very fuzzy and vague. We need models that can transparently generate reasoning about their predictions like old school expert systems which used to work on symbolic knowledge, so the architectures based on the amalgam of deep learning techniques and Symbolic representations would also be a part of our discussion. We will also shed some light on the impact of transformers in the field of deep learning and how these transformer based models are quickly becoming state-of-the-art in almost every deep learning task. © 2021 IEEE.",Graph Convolutional Networks; Image Semantic Understanding; Natural Language Processing; Transformers; Visual Question Answering,Deep learning; Expert systems; Intelligent systems; Natural language processing systems; Cognitive capability; Human cognitive abilities; Learning techniques; Nlp (natural language processing); Question-answer pairs; Scientific researches; Symbolic representation; Visual interpretation; Learning systems,"Khurram, I., Fraz, M.M., Shahzad, M., Detailed sentence generation architecture for image semantics description (2018) International Symposium on Visual Computing, pp. 423-432. , Springer; Khurram, I., Fraz, M., Shahzad, M., Rajpoot, N., Dense-captionnet: A sentence generation architecture for fine-grained description of image semantics (2020) Cognitive Computation, pp. 1-17; Mikolov, T., Chen, K., Corrado, G., Dean, J., Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space (2013) Iclr (Workshop Poster); Rizvi, S.K.J., Azad, M.A., Fraz, M.M., Spectrum of advancements and developments in multidisciplinary domains for generative adversarial networks (gans) (2021) Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering, pp. 1-19; Mogadala, A., Kalimuthu, M., Klakow, D., (2019) Trends in Integration of Vision and Language Research: A Survey of Tasks, Datasets, and Methods, , arXiv preprint; Srivastava, Y., Murali, V., Dubey, S.R., Mukherjee, S., (2019) Visual Question Answering Using Deep Learning: A Survey and Performance Analysis, , arXiv preprint; Marino, K., Chen, X., Parikh, D., Gupta, A., Rohrbach, M., (2020) Krisp: Integrating Implicit and Symbolic Knowledge for Open-Domain Knowledge-Based Vqa; Antol, S., Agrawal, A., Lu, J., Mitchell, M., Batra, D., Zitnick, C.L., Parikh, D., Vqa: Visual question answering (2015) Proceedings of the Ieee International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December; Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L., Microsoft coco: Common objects in context (2014) European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 740-755. , Springer; Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Li, F., Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations (2016) CoRR, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07332, vol. abs/1602.07332, [Online]; Johnson, J., Hariharan, B., Maaten Der, L.Van, Fei-Fei, L., Lawrence Zitnick, C., Girshick, R., Clevr: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning (2017) Proceedings of the Ieee Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2901-2910; Acharya, M., Kafle, K., Kanan, C., Tallyqa: Answering complex counting questions (2018) CoRR, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12440, vol. abs/1810.12440, [Online]; Marino, K., Rastegari, M., Farhadi, A., Mottaghi, R., Ok-vqa: A visual question answering benchmark requiring external knowledge (2019) Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); Hudson, D.A., Manning, C.D., Gqa: A new dataset for real-world visual reasoning and compositional question answering (2019) Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 6700-6709; Shah, S., Mishra, A., Yadati, N., Talukdar, P.P., Kvqa: Knowledge-aware visual question answering (2019) Proceedings of the Aaai Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 33 (1), pp. 8876-8884; Ahmed, S.B., Ali, S.F., Ahmad, J., Adnan, M., Fraz, M.M., On the frontiers of pose invariant face recognition: A review (2020) Artificial Intelligence Review, 53 (4), pp. 2571-2634; Auer, S., Bizer, C., Kobilarov, G., Lehmann, J., Cyganiak, R., Ives, Z., Dbpedia: A nucleus for a web of open data (2007) The Semantic Web, pp. 722-735. , Springer; Bhakthavatsalam, S., Richardson, K., Tandon, N., Clark, P., (2020) Do Dogs Have Whiskers?

Sentiment analysis is an application of Natural Language Processing and text analysis which helps to identify the emotions in a given context. In this work a hybrid approach for Sentiment Analysis is used in which Machine Learning method is used for tagging and Fuzzy Logic is used to find the membership of the review in each sentiment class. Fuzzy logic can be used to handle the vagueness in natural language. Manually tagged data are trained using TnT and Fuzzy rules are incorporated for identifying and classifying the emotions.

AI offers substantial capabilities to solve new problems and optimise existing solutions specialising on specific problems and learning from different domains. AI solutions can be either explainable or black box ones with the latter being urged to improve since they cannot trust. Case-based Reasoning (CBR) is an explainable AI approach where solutions are provided along with relevant explanations in terms of why a solution was selected. However, CBR, like most other explainable approaches, has several limitations in terms of scalability, large data volumes, domain complexity, that reduce its ability to scale any CBR system in industrial applications. In this paper, we provide a heterogeneous CBR framework - DeepKAF where we combine CBR paradigm with Deep Learning architectures to solve complicated Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems (eg. mixed language and grammatically incorrect text).DeepKAF is built based on continuous research in the area of Deep Learning and CBR. DeepKAF has been implemented and used across different domains, test use cases and research models as an ensemble deep learning and CBR Architecture. © 2020 IEEE.",Case-based Reasoning; Deep Learning; Natural Language Processing,Case based reasoning; Intelligent systems; Natural language processing systems; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Different domains; Large data volumes; Learning approach; Learning architectures; NAtural language processing; Research models; Specific problems; Deep learning,"Aamodt, A., Plaza, E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches (1994) AI Communications, 1 (7). , March; Goel, A.K., Diaz-Agudo, B., What's hot in case-based reasoning Proceedings of the Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-17); Amin, K., Lancaster, G., Kapetanakis, S., Althoff, K.D., Dengel, A., Petridis, M., Case-based reasoning in natural language processing: Word2vec vs fasttext 23rd UK Symposium on Case-Based Reasoning, , Cambridge; Amin, K., Lancaster, G., Kapetanakis, S., Althoff, K.D., Dengel, A., Petridis, M., Advanced similarity measures using wordembeddings and siamese networks in cbr. in. intelligent systems and applications (2019) IntelliSys 2019.

Despite deep learning models have shown strong performance on various cross-sentence inference benchmarks, recent work has shown that they are leveraging spurious statistical cues rather than capturing deeper implied relations between pairs of sentences. In this paper, we show that the state-of-the-art language encoding models are especially bad at modeling directional relations between sentences by proposing a new evaluation task: Cause-and-Effect relation prediction task. Back by our curated Causeand-Effect Relation dataset (CER), we also demonstrate that a mutual attention mechanism can guide the model to focus on capturing directional relations between sentences when added to existing transformer-based models. Experiment results show that the proposed approach improves the performance on downstream applications, such as the abductive reasoning task. © 2020 The Twenty-Fifth AAAI/SIGAI Doctoral Consortium (AAAI-20).

Treating negation in an adequate way is required for cognitive reasoning, which aims at modeling the human ability to draw meaningful conclusions despite incomplete and inconsistent knowledge. One task of cognitive reasoning is answering questions given by sentences in natural language. There are tools based on discourse representation theory to convert sentences automatically into a formal logic representation, and additional knowledge can be added using the predicate names in the formula and knowledge databases. However, the knowledge in logic databases in practice always is incomplete. Hence, forward reasoning of automated reasoning systems alone does not suffice to derive answers to questions because, instead of complete proofs, often only partial positive knowledge can be derived, while negative knowledge is used only during the reasoning process. In consequence, we aim at eliminating syntactic negation, strictly speaking, the negated event or property. In this paper, we describe an effective procedure to determine the negated event or property in order to replace it by its inverse. This lays the basis of cognitive reasoning, employing both logic and machine learning for general question answering. We evaluate our procedure by several benchmarks and demonstrate its practical usefulness in our cognitive reasoning system. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Automated reasoning; Cognitive reasoning; Negation,Computer circuits; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Additional knowledge; Automated reasoning; Cognitive reasoning; Discourse representation theory; Human abilities; Logic representation; Natural languages; Negation; Property; Reasoning system; Formal logic,"Agirre, E., Bos, J., Diab, M., Manandhar, S., Marton, Y., Yuret, D.

The obtained mining model represents knowledge derived from the analyzed text which is hard to interpret as it lacks context. Enhancement of its semantic value can be obtained by implementing logic based approach providing formally defined meaning and interpretation mechanism. The generally accepted form for representation of knowledge for existing domain is by domain-specific ontology. The aim of the paper consists in designing a framework for performing ontology instantiation and population with the structures of a complex mining model involving classification and association rules. Procedures have been designed for annotating them with domain concepts and semantic types. The framework provides for turning the mining model into a context model. Ontology reasoning is implemented to validate the input mining model by rule semantic disambiguation and dependency conceptualization. The framework implementation provides for outputting validated domain-related knowledge base in explicit and machine-readable form as a resource that can be adapted for decision support.,Context model; Domain ontology; Knowledge management; Ontology reasoning; Text analysis; Text mining,Data mining; Decision support systems; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Software design; Systems engineering; Context modeling; Domain ontologies; Ontology reasonings; Text analysis; Text mining; Ontology,"Albitar, S., Fournier, S., Espinasse, B., The Impact of conceptualization on text classification (2012) Web Information Systems Engineering - WISE 2012, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7651, pp. 326-339. , X.

The convolutional neural network (CNN) which is one of the most important algorithms in deep learning plays an important role in computer vision and natural language processing. With machine learning becomes more complex, the amount of data and the amount of computation in CNN increase dramatically. A large amount of data multiplexing consumes a lot of data handling time for the traditional CPU (Von Neumann Architecture and Harvard Architecture). The data processing speed affects the CPU performance. Increasing computation speed and reducing data multiplexing have become the primary goal of neural network accelerators. © 2019 IEEE.",CNN; hardware acceleration; sequential logic design; systolic arrays,Computation theory; Convolution; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Systolic arrays; Computation speed; Convolutional neural network; Data multiplexing; Hardware acceleration; Harvard architectures; NAtural language processing; Neumann architecture; Sequential logic; Data handling,"Mnih, V., Hinton, G., Learning to label aerial images from noisy data (2013) Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (icml-12, pp. 567-574; Maass, W., Networks of spiking neurons: The third generation of neural network models (1997) Neural Networks, 10 (9), pp. 1659-1671. , Dec; Yu, Z.J., Ma, D., Yan, X.L., Shen, J.C., FPGA-based accelerator for convolutional neural network (2016) Computer Engineering, pp. 109-114. , April; Lu, H.T., Zhang, Q.C., Applications of deep convolutional neural network in computer vision (2016) Journal of Data Acquisition and Processing, pp. 1-17. , Jan; Wang, K.K., Wang, K.Y., Li, K.S., Small text image refocusing using convolutional neural network (2018) Journal of Xidian University, pp. 80-85; Krizhevskya, A., Stuskever, I., Hinton, G., Image net classification with deep convolutional neural net works (2012) International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105; Gonzalez, A.J., Nencioni, G., Helvik, B.E., Kamisinski, A.J., A fault-tolerant and consistent sdn controller (2016) Global Communications Conference 2016, pp. 1-6. , ieee, Dec; Fang, R., Liu, J.H., Xue, Z.H., Yang, G.W., Design of parallel acceleration scheme for convolutional neural network based on fpga (2015) Computer Engineering and Application, pp. 31-36; Szegedy, C., Liu, W., Jia, Y.Q., Sermanet, P., Scott, R., Anguelov, D., Going deeper with convolutions (2015) 2015 Ieee Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition(CVPR, pp. 1-5; Yu, Q., (2007) Research on Reliability Assessment Technology of Special Instruction Set Processor, , University of Science and Technology of China","Zhou, J.email: zhoujy@xmu.edu.cn",,IEEE,"13th IEEE International Conference on Anti-Counterfeiting, Security, and Identification, ASID 2019",25 October 2019 through 27 October 2019,,155970,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077521408

The availability of large idea repositories (e.g., the U.S. patent database) could significantly accelerate innovation and discovery in a way never previously possible. Previous approaches have been limited by relying on hand-created databases that have high relational structure but are very sparse (e.g., predicate calculus representations). Traditional machine-learning/information-retrieval similarity metrics (e.g., LSA) can scale to large, natural-language datasets; however, while these methods are good at detecting surface similarity, they struggle to account for structural similarity. In this paper, we propose to leverage crowdsourcing techniques to construct a dataset with rich ""analogy-tuning"" signals, used to guide machine learning models towards matches based on relations rather than surface features. We demonstrate our approach with a crowdsourced analogy identification task, whose results are used to train deep learning algorithms. Our initial results suggest that a deep learning model trained on positive/negative example analogies from the task can find more analogous matches than an LSA baseline, and that incorporating behavioral signals (such as queries used to retrieve an analogy) can further boost its performance.

Given the words and their morphosyntactic class, a chunker will decide which words can be grouped as chunks. Malayalam is a free word order language and has relatively unrestricted phrase structures that make the problem of chunking quite challenging. This paper aims to develop a text chunker for Malayalam using Memory-Based Learning (MBL) approach. Memory-Based Learning is a machine learning methodology based on the idea that the direct reuse of examples using analogical reasoning is more suited for solving language processing problems than the application of rules extracted from those examples. The chunker was trained using the tool Memory-Based Tagger (MBT) with words and their POS tags as features.

This paper discusses some of the motivating factors behind US Army Research in AI and ML and provides a survey of a subset of the US Army Research Laboratory's (ARL) Computational and Information Sciences Directorate's (CISD) recent research in online, nonparametric learning that quickly adapts to variable underlying distributions in sparse exemplar environments, as well as a technique for unsupervised semantic scene labeling that continuously learns and adapts semantic models discovered within a data stream. We also look at a newly developed algorithm that leverages human input to help intelligent agents learn more rapidly and a novel research study working to discover foundational knowledge that is required for humans and robots to communicate via natural language. Finally we discuss a method for finding chains of reasoning with incomplete information using semantic vectors.

An executor for table querying typically requires multiple steps of execution because queries may have complicated structures. In previous studies, researchers have developed either fully distributed executors or symbolic executors for table querying. A distributed executor can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, but is weak in terms of execution efficiency and explicit interpretability. A symbolic executor is efficient in execution, but is very difficult to train especially at initial stages. In this paper, we propose to couple distributed and symbolic execution for natural language queries, where the symbolic executor is pretrained with the distributed executor's intermediate execution results in a step-by-step fashion. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms both distributed and symbolic executors, exhibiting high accuracy, high learning efficiency, high execution efficiency, and high interpretability. © 2017 by the author(s).",,Artificial intelligence; Couplings; Deep learning; Efficiency; Knowledge based systems; Model checking; Natural language processing systems; Complicated structures; Interpretability; Knowledge base; Learning efficiency; Natural language queries; Natural languages; Research topics; Symbolic execution; Computer control systems,"Berant, J., Chou, A., Frostig, R., Liang, P., Semantic parsing on Freebase from question-answer pairs (2013) EMNLP, pp. 1533-1544; Dong, L., Lapata, M., Language to logical form with neural attention (2016) ACL, pp. 33-43; Graves, A., Wayne, G., Danihelka, I., (2014) Neural Turing Machines, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Hu, Z., Ma, X., Liu, Z., Hovy, E., Xing, E., Harnessing deep neural networks with logic rules (2016) ACL, pp. 2410-2420; Jordan, M.I., Serial order: A parallel distributed processing approach (1997) Advances in Psychology, 121, pp. 471-495; Lei, T., Barzilay, R., Jaakkola, T., Rationalizing neural predictions (2016) EMNLP, pp. 107-117; Liang, C., Berant, J., Le, Q., Forbus, K.D., Lao, N., Neural symbolic machines: Learning semantic parsers on Freebase with weak supervision (2017) ACL (To Appear); Mesnil, G., He, X., Deng, L., Bengio, Y., Investigation of recurrent-neural-network architectures and learning methods for spoken language understanding (2013) INTERSPEECH, pp. 3771-3775; Mi, H., Sankaran, B., Wang, Z., Itty-Cheriah, A., Coverage embedding models for neural machine translation (2016) EMNLP, pp. 955-960; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G.S., Dean, J., Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality (2013) NIPS, pp. 3111-3119; Neelakantan, A., Le, Q.V., Sutskever, I., Neural programmer: Inducing latent programs with gradient descent (2016) ICLR; Pasupat, P., Liang, P., Compositional semantic parsing on semi-structured tables (2015) ACL-IJCNLP, pp. 1470-1480; Ranzato, M., Chopra, S., Auli, M., Zaremba, W., Sequence level training with recurrent neural networks (2016) ICLR; Reed, S., De Freitas, N., Neural programmer-interpreters (2016) ICLR; Sutton, R.S., Batto, A.G., (1998) Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, , MIT Press Cambridge; Wen, T.-H., Vandyke, D., MrkSié, N., Gaste, M., Rojas, B., Lina, M., Su, P.-H., Young, S., A network-based end-to-end trainable task-oriented dialogue system (2017) EACL, pp. 438-449; Williams, R.J., Simple statistical gradient-following algorithms for connectionist reinforcement learning (1992) Machine Learning, 8 (3), pp. 229-256; Xiao, C., Dymetman, M., Gardent, C., Sequence-based structured prediction for semantic parsing (2016) ACL, pp. 1341-1350; Yin, J., Jiang, X., Lu, Z., Shang, L., Li, H., Li, X., Neural generative question answering (2016) IJCAI, pp. 2972-2978; Yin, P., Lu, Z., Hang, L., Kao, B., Neural enquirer: Learning to query tables with natural language (2016) IJCAI, pp. 2308-2314; Zhou, H., Tu, Z., Huang, S., Liu, X., Li, H., Chen, J., Chunk-based bi-scale decoder for neural machine translation (2017) ACL","Mou, L.; Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (Peking University), China; email: doublepower.mou@gmail.com",,International Machine Learning Society (IMLS),"International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML",6 August 2017 through 11 August 2017,,136027,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048473310

While different methods have been developed to represent the environment information and language actions, existing RL agents are not empowered with any reasoning capabilities to deal with textual games. In this work, we aim to conduct explicit reasoning with knowledge graphs for decision making, so that the actions of an agent are generated and supported by an interpretable inference procedure. We propose a stacked hierarchical attention mechanism to construct an explicit representation of the reasoning process by exploiting the structure of the knowledge graph. We extensively evaluate our method on a number of man-made benchmark games, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method performs better than existing text-based agents. © 2020 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Rulelog matches well many of the requirements of cognitive computing. It combines deep logical/probabilistic reasoning tightly with natural language processing (NLP), and complements machine learning (ML). Rulelog interoperates and composes well with graph databases, relational databases, spreadsheets, XML, and expressively simpler rule/ontology systems and can orchestrate overall hybrid KRR. Developed mainly since 2005, Rulelog is much more expressively powerful than the previous state-of-the-art practical KRR approaches, yet is computationally affordable. It is fully semantic and has capable efficient implementations that leverage methods from logic programming and databases, including dependency-aware smart caching and a dynamic compilation stack architecture.",Cognitive computing; Declarative logic programs; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Natural language processing; Semantic rules,Computation theory; Computer programming languages; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logic programming; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Cognitive Computing; Declarative logic; Efficient implementation; Emerging applications; Expressive semantics; Fundamental concepts; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Semantic rules; Computer circuits,"Andersen, C., Benyo, B., Calejo, M., Dean, M., Fodor, P., Grosof, B.N., Kifer, M., Swift, T., Advanced knowledge base debugging for rulelog (2013) Joint Proceedings of the 7th International Rule Challenge, the Special Track on Human Language Technology and the 3rd RuleML Doctoral Consortium, , http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-104/paper8.pdf, Seattle, USA, July 11 -13, 2013; Bonner, A., Kifer, M., (1993) Transaction Logic: Unifying Declarative and Procedural Knowledge, , manuscript; Chen, W., Kifer, M., Warren, D., HiLog: A foundation for higher-order logic programming (1993) Journal of Logic Programming, 15 (3), pp. 187-230. , February; Grosof, B., Rapid text-based authoring of defeasible higher-order logic formulas, via textual logic and rulelog (2013) Theory, Practice, and Applications of Rules on the Web, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8035, pp. 2-11. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39617-5_2, Morgenstern, L., Stefaneas, P., Lvy, F., Wyner, A., Paschke, A.

Given an image with a simple linear algebraic equation system and a question in natural language based on the variables in the equations, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model that produces accurate answers to questions pertaining to the value of the variables and other related questions. Modeling the problem of solving simple linear equations as a VQA task makes it interesting as the system now requires three kinds of understanding a) visual understanding to recognize digits, variables, operators and equal sign b) conceptual understanding of the symbolic meanings of coefficients' constants, variables, operators and equality and c) high level understanding of the interaction between the image and the questions in order to accurately answer them.

Existing deep learning approaches for semantic parsing have shown promise on a variety of benchmark data sets, particularly on textto- SQL parsing. However, most text-to-SQL parsers do not generalize to unseen data sets in different domains. In this paper, we propose a new cross-domain learning scheme to perform text-to-SQL translation and demonstrate its use on Spider, a large-scale cross-domain text-to-SQL data set. We improve upon a state-of-the-art Spider model, SyntaxSQLNet, by constructing a graph of column names for all databases and using graph neural networks to compute their embeddings. The resulting embeddings offer better cross-domain representations and SQL queries, as evidenced by substantial improvement on the Spider data set compared to SyntaxSQLNet. © 2019 EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 - Graph-Based Methods for Natural Language Processing - Proceedings of the 13th Workshop.

However, language reasoning and understanding remain difficult tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this work, we consider this problem and propose a novel Knowledge-Infused Document Embedding Representation (KIDER) for text categorization. We use knowledge patterns to generate high quality document representation. These patterns preserve categorical-distinctive semantic information, provide interpretability, and achieve superior performances at the same time. Experiments show that the KIDER model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two important NLP tasks, i.e., emotion analysis and news topic detection, by 7% and 20%. In addition, we also demonstrate the potential of highlighting important information for each category and news using these patterns. These results show the value of knowledge-infused patterns in terms of interpretability and performance enhancement. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Knowledge representation; Natural Language Processing; Text categorization,Deep learning; Embeddings; Intelligent systems; Semantics; Text processing; Document Representation; Knowledge patterns; NAtural language processing; News topic detections; Performance enhancements; Semantic information; State-of-the-art methods; Text categorization; Natural language processing systems,"Aggarwal, C.C., Zhai, C., (2012) Mining Text Data, , Springer Science & Business Media, Heidelberg; Wu, H., Salton, G., A comparison of search term weighting: term relevance vs. inverse document frequency (1981) ACM SIGIR Forum, 16, pp. 30-39. , ACM; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G.S., Dean, J., Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality (2013) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3111-3119; LeCun, Y., Backpropagation applied to handwritten zip code recognition (1989) Neural Comput, 1 (4), pp. 541-551; Hochreiter, S., Schmidhuber, J., Long short-term memory (1997) Neural Comput, 9 (8), pp. 1735-1780; Devlin, J., Chang, M.W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., (2018) BERT: pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04805; Lee, J.Y., Dernoncourt, F., (2016) Sequential short-text classification with recurrent and convolutional neural networks, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.03827; Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., (2014) Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.0473; Alexander, J.A., (1994) Template-based procedures for neural network interpretation, , Ph.D. thesis, University of Colorado; Seidenberg, M., (2017) Language at the Speed of Sight How We Read, Why So Many Can’t, and What Can Be Done About It, , 1st edn.

Recently, a new VSA based on multiplication of distributed vectors by random matrices was proposed, this is known as Matrix-Binding-of-Additive-Terms (MBAT). We propose an enhancement that introduces an important additional feature to MBAT: the ability to 'unbind' symbols. We show that our method, which exploits the inherent properties of orthogonal matrices, imparts MBAT with the 'question answering' ability found in other VSAs. We compare our results with another popular VSA that was recently demonstrated to have high utility in brain-inspired machine learning applications. © 2014 IEEE.",brain-inspired machine learning; complex structure methodology; distributed representation; natural language processing; vector symbolic architecture,Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Brain; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Vectors; Brain-inspired; Complex structure; Distributed representation; Machine learning applications; NAtural language processing; Natural languages; Orthogonal matrix; Question Answering; Matrix algebra,"Gallant, S.I., Okaywe, T.W., Representing objects, relations, and sequences (2013) Neural Computation, 25, pp. 2038-2078; Kanerva, P., The spatter code for encoding concepts at many levels (1994) ICANN, pp. 226-229; Plate, T.A., (2003) Holographic Reduced Representation, , CSLI Publications: Center for the Study of Language and Information Stanford California; Rachkovskij, D.A., Kussul, E.M., Binding and normalisation of binary sparse distributes representations by contextdependent thinning (2001) Neural Computation, 13, pp. 411-452; Gayler, R., Multiplicative Binding, representation operators and analogy (1998) Advances in Analogy Research: Integration of Theory and Data from the Cognitive, Computational, and Neural Sciences; Stewart, T.C., Tang, Y., Eliasmith, C., A biologically realistic cleanup memory: Autoassociation in spiking neurons (2011) Cognitive Systems Research, 12, pp. 84-92; Stewart, T., Eliasmith, C., Large-scale synthesis of functional spiking neural circuits (2014) Proceedings of the IEEE, , Accepted-In Press; Eliasmith, C., Stewart, T.C., Choo, X., Bekolay, T., Dewolf, T., Tang, Y., Rasmussen, D., A large-scale model of the functioning brain (2012) Science, 338, pp. 1202-1205; Anton, H., (2010) Elementary Linear Algebra, , Wiley; Stewart, T.C., (2014) Private Communication, , 29 January 2014; Tapson, J., Van Schaik, A., Learning the pseudoinverse solution to network weights (2013) Neural Networks, 45, pp. 94-100",,,IEEE,"IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing, ICSC",16 June 2014 through 18 June 2014,"Newport Beach, CA",107405,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906991127

First, we summarize past and recent advancements in predicting verdicts and other attributes of legal text written in different languages. We then demonstrate data preparation of all publicly available Slovak judgements, extraction of their verdicts and separation into main parts using a Slovak words inflexion dictionary called Tvaroslovník. Later we use this data to classify the judgements into acquittal or conviction using several known machine learning methods ranging from simple statistical methods such as SVM and random forests to deep learning networks based on convolution to recurrence and their combinations. We evaluate their efficiency, analyze and identify significant highly correlated terms with each result class, and offer a hypothesis as to why these terms are correlated with these results. We have found that a sequential input of word2vec embeddings combined with convolution-based deep learning methods produces the best results, achieving over 99% accuracy.

At the same time, deep learning technologies have also grown significantly. Thus, it is essential to investigate the hardware acceleration and deployment of deep learning algorithms on edge devices. Two types of deep neural networks RNN and CNN are widely used for NLP (Natural Language Processing). Recent exploration of CNN based methods for NLP has proven that they are fast and effective. In this paper, we discuss multi-class text classification using 1D Temporal convolutional neural networks. We have explored the acceleration and deployment of our model on the Xilinx PYNQ (Python Productivity for ZYNQ) FPGA board. In this paper, we explored the features of character-level text classification which proves to be a perfect fit for edge applications owing to adaptivity to misspelled, infrequent words or informal text, lightweight models, and low latency. We have accelerated our text classification model using coarse pruning and quantization. The deployment exploits the strong relationship of a sequential processor with a PL (programmable logic) as an accelerator, to implement power efficient and low latency inference machine learning architecture. The model is evaluated on a dataset of reviews for several brands. A method of evaluation robustness of text classifications model, for informal language and misspellings, is also proposed. Compared to GPU, after proposed hardware acceleration a 50% drop in latency and a 1500% decrease in power has been observed on an FPGA. © 2021 IEEE.",CNN; Embedded; FPGA; Hardware Acceleration; NLP; Text Classification; ZYNQ,Classification (of information); Computation theory; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Recurrent neural networks; Hardware acceleration; Internet of thing (IOT); Learning technology; Nlp (natural language processing); Programmable logic; Sequential processors; Text classification; Text classification models; Text processing,"Schultz, J., How much data is created on the internet each day?

Current DL methods should provide contextual reasoning, explainable results, and repeatable understanding that require evaluation methods. This paper discusses DL techniques using multimodal (or multisource) information that extend measures of performance (MOP). Examples of joint multi-modal learning include imagery and text, video and radar, and other common sensor types. Issues with joint multimodal learning challenge many current methods and care is needed to apply machine learning methods. Results from Deep Multimodal Image Fusion (DMIF) using Electro-optical and infrared data demonstrate performance modeling based on distance to better understand DL robustness and quality to provide situation awareness. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Scientific research on PIL reveals the need to create a bridge between European and national laws. In this context, legal experts have to access heterogeneous sources, being able to recall all the norms and to combine them using case-laws and following the principles of interpretation theory. This clearly poses a daunting challenge to humans, whenever Regulations change frequently or are big-enough in size. Automated reasoning over legal texts is not a trivial task, because legal language is very specific and in many ways different from a commonly used natural language. When applying state-of-the-art language models to legalese understanding, one of the challenges is always to figure how to optimally use the available amount of data. This makes hard to apply state-of-the-art sub-symbolic question answering algorithms on legislative texts, especially the PIL ones, because of data scarcity. In this paper we try to expand previous works on legal question answering, publishing a larger and more curated dataset for the evaluation of automated question answering on PIL. © 2021 ACM.",knowledge graph extraction; legal question answering; private international law,Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing systems; Automated reasoning; Heterogeneous sources; Legal questions; Natural languages; Private international law; Question Answering; Scientific researches; State of the art; Laws and legislation,"Ashley, K.D., (2017) Artificial Intelligence and Legal Analytics: New Tools for Law Practice in the Digital Age, , Cambridge University Press; Bench-Capon, T., Araszkiewicz, M., Ashley, K., Atkinson, K., Bex, F., Borges, F., Bourcier, D., Francesconi, E., A history of AI and law in 50 papers: 25 years of the international conference on ai and law (2012) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 20 (3), pp. 215-319. , 2012; Ii, M.J.B., Katz, D.M., Detterman, E.M., (2018) Lex NLP: Natural Language Processing and Information Extraction for Legal and Regulatory Texts, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.03688 (2018); Casanovas, P., Palmirani, M., Peroni, S., Van Engers, T., Vitali, F., Semantic web for the legal domain: The next step (2016) Semantic Web, 7 (3), pp. 213-227. , 2016; Chalkidis, I., Kampas, D., Deep learning in law: Early adaptation and legal word embeddings trained on large corpora (2019) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 27 (2), pp. 171-198. , 2019; Conrad, J.G., Zeleznikow, J., The significance of evaluation in AI and law: A case study re-examining ICAIL proceedings (2013) Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 186-191; Do, P.-K., Nguyen, H.-T., Tran, C.-X., Nguyen, M.-T., Nguyen, M.-L., (2017) Legal Question Answering Using Ranking SVM and Deep Convolutional Neural Network, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.05320 2017; Fernández-Barrera, M., Sartor, G., The legal theory perspective: Doctrinal conceptual systems vs. Computational ontologies (2011) Approaches to Legal Ontologies, pp. 15-47. , Springer; Holzenberger, N., Blair-Stanek, A., Van Durme, B., (2020) A Dataset for Statutory Reasoning in Tax Law Entailment and Question Answering, , arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.05257 (2020); Kim, M.-Y., Xu, Y., Goebel, R., A convolutional neural network in legal question answering (2015) JURISIN Workshop; Kratochwil, F.V., (1991) Rules, Norms, and Decisions: On the Conditions of Practical and Legal Reasoning in International Relations and Domestic Affairs, (2). , Cambridge University Press; Ravichander, A., Black, A.W., Wilson, S., Norton, T., Sadeh, N., (2019) Question Answering for Privacy Policies: Combining Computational and Legal Perspectives, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.00841 (2019); Sovrano, F., Palmirani, M., Vitali, F., Legal knowledge extraction for knowledge graph based question-answering (2020) Legal Knowledge and Information Systems: JURIX 2020.

KGs can be created in several ways: manually with forms or automatically with Information Extraction (IE), a natural language processing task for extracting knowledge from text. Relation Extraction is the part of IE that focuses on identifying relations between named entities in texts, which amounts to find new edges in a KG. Most recent approaches rely on deep learning, achieving state-of-the-art performances. However, those performances are still too low to fully automatize the construction of reliable KGs, and human interaction remains necessary. This is made difficult by the statistical nature of deep learning methods that makes their predictions hardly interpretable. In this paper, we present a new symbolic and interpretable approach for Relation Extraction in texts. It is based on a modeling of the lexical and syntactic structure of text as a knowledge graph, and it exploits Concepts of Neighbours, a method based on Graph-FCA for computing similarities in knowledge graphs. An evaluation has been performed on a subset of TACRED (a relation extraction benchmark), showing promising results. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Deep learning; Information analysis; Knowledge representation; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Syntactics; Human interactions; Knowledge graphs; Learning methods; Named entities; NAtural language processing; Relation extraction; State-of-the-art performance; Syntactic structure; Formal concept analysis,"Ferré, S., Cellier, P., Graph-, F.C.A., An extension of formal concept analysis to knowledge graphs (2019) Discrete Appl.

We present a deep architecture in the framework of Learning from Constraints [5] that is trained to identify mentions to entities and relations belonging to a given ontology. Each input word is encoded into two latent representations with different coverage of the local context, that are exploited to predict the type of entity and of relation to which the word belongs. Our model combines an entropy-based regularizer and a set of First-Order Logic formulas that bridge the predictions on entity and relation types accordingly to the ontology structure. As a result, the system generates symbolic descriptions of the raw text that are interpretable and well-suited to attach human-level knowledge. We evaluate the model on a dataset composed of sentences about simple facts, that we make publicly available. The proposed system can efficiently learn to discover mentions with very few human supervisions and that the relation to knowledge in the form of logic constraints improves the quality of the system predictions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",Deep Learning; Information Extraction; Learning from Constraints; Symbolic knowledge representation,Computer circuits; Data mining; Forecasting; Formal logic; Information retrieval; Knowledge representation; Neural networks; Ontology; Pattern recognition; Deep architectures; First order logic; Human supervision; Learning from constraints; Symbolic description; Symbolic knowledge; Symbolic processing; System prediction; Deep learning,"Bengio, Y., Ducharme, R., Vincent, P., Jauvin, C., A neural probabilistic language model (2003) J.

To do this, the choice of an ideal representation is guided by the domain characteristics and the complexity of its cases. Recently, the explosion of deep learning techniques and other forms of vectorised representations, has provided a new source for case insights. Richer text features can be extracted and used for each case if required. In this paper, we build on recent work in this area and generate richer case representation by automatically acquiring domain knowledge from unstructured sentences. We describe how the Deep Knowledge Acquisition Framework obtains its representation vectors from stemmed words and improving these vectors iteratively, suggesting high quality outputs and relevance to domain experts based on either explicit queries or their past intentions. We evaluate these ideas using two, not related, datasets from the automotive and legal domains respectively. The results show the benefits of combining Autoencoders and Siamese Networks in CBR while achieving better textual data dimensionality reduction, data de-noising and similarity measures. © 2019 IEEE.",Autoencoders; Case-based Reasoning; Deep Learning; Multi-lingual Text Analysis; Natural Language Processing; Siamese Networks; Textual CBR,Deep learning; Dimensionality reduction; Iterative methods; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Autoencoders; Case representation; Data de-noising; Domain knowledge; Learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Similarity measure; Text analysis; Case based reasoning,"Aamodt, A., Plaza, E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches (1994) AI Communications, 1 (7). , March; Jalali, V., Leake, D., CBR meets big data: A case study of large-scale adaptation rule generation (2015) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, pp. 181-196; Daengdej, J., Lukose, D., Tsui, E., Beinat, P., Prophet, L., Dynamically creating indices for two million cases: A real world problem (1996) Advances in Case-Based Reasoning, p. 105119. , Berlin, Springer; Beaver, I., Dumoulin, J., Applying mapreduce to learning user preferences in near realtime (2014) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, ICCBR 2014, p. 1528. , Berlin, Springer; Plaza, E., Semantics and experience in the future web (2008) Proceedings of the Ninth European Conference on Case-Based Reasoning, p. 4458. , Springer; Ontanon, S., Lee, Y.C., Snodgrass, S., Bonfiglio, D., Winston, F., Mc-Donald, C., Gonzalez, A., Case-based prediction of teen driver behavior and skill (2014) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, ICCBR 2014, p. 375389. , Berlin, Springer; Cordier, A., Lefevre, M., Champin, P.A., Georgeon, O., Mille, A., Tracebased reasoning modeling interaction traces for reasoning on experiences (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Florida AI Research Symposium, p. 363368. , AAAI Press; Amin, K., Kapetanakis, S., Althoff, K.D., Dengel, A., Petridis, M., Answering with cases: A cbr approach to deep learning (2018) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development.

They have applications in machine learning and for understanding information processing in neurobiology. VSAs are typically described in an abstract mathematical form in terms of vectors and operations on vectors. In this work, we show that a machine learning approach known as hierarchical temporal memory, which is based on the anatomy and function of mammalian neocortex, is inherently capable of supporting important VSA functionality. This follows because the approach learns sequences of semantics-preserving sparse distributed representations. © 2014 IEEE.",hierarchical temporal memory; natural language processing; semantic symbols; sparse distributed representations; vector symbolic architecture,Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mammals; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Distributed representation; High-dimensional; Machine learning approaches; Mathematical forms; NAtural language processing; Semantic symbols; Temporal memory; Vectors,"Gallant, S.I., Okaywe, T.W., Representing objects, relations, and sequences (2013) Neural Computation, 25, pp. 2038-2078; Plate, T.A., Holographic reduced representations IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 6, pp. 623-641; Kanerva, P., The spatter code for encoding concepts at many levels (1994) ICANN, pp. 226-229; Rachkovskij, D.A., Kussul, E.M., Binding and normalisation of binary sparse distributed representations by contextdependent thinning (2001) Neural Computation, 13, pp. 411-452; Stewart, T.C., Eliasmith, C., Large-scale synthesis of functional spiking neural circuits (2014) Proceedings of the IEEE, , In Press; George, D., Hawkins, J., Towards a mathematical theory of cortical micro-circuits (2009) PLoS Computational Biology, 5, pp. e1000532; Hawkins, J., Ahmad, S., Dubinsky, D., (2011) Hierarchical Temporal Memory Including HTM Cortical Learning Algorithms, , Numenta Inc., Tech.

However, the correct specification and interpretation of temporal logic formulas require a strong mathematical background and can hardly be done by domain experts, who, instead, tend to rely on a natural language description of the intended system behaviour. In such situations, a system that is able to automatically translate English sentences into LTL formulas, and vice versa, would be of great help. While the task of rendering an LTL formula into a more readable English sentence may be carried out in a relatively easy way by properly parsing the formula, the converse is still an open problem, due to the inherent difficulty of interpreting free, natural language texts. Although several partial solutions have been proposed in the past, the literature still lacks a critical assessment of the work done. We address such a shortcoming, presenting the current state of the art for what concerns the English-to-LTL translation problem, and outlining some possible research directions. © Michael H.

The concept uses the corpus of two languages and then translates the input text to desired target text by proper matching. The different languages have different language structure of the subject-object-verb (SOV) alignment. The matching is then arranged to give proper meaning in target text language and to form proper structure. This paper, describes the Example Based Machine Translation using Natural Language Processing demo. The proposed EBMT framework can be used for automatic translation of text by reusing the examples of previous translations through the use of Fuzzy which is proposed work. This framework comprises of three phases, matching, alignment and recombination.

This assumption can lead to unpredictable behaviour during operation, whenever novel, previously unseen, classes appear. Although deep learning-based methods have recently been used for novelty detection, they are challenging to interpret due to their black-box nature. This paper addresses interpretable open-world text classification, where the trained classifier must deal with novel classes during operation. To this end, we extend the recently introduced Tsetlin machine (TM) with a novelty scoring mechanism. The mechanism uses the conjunctive clauses of the TM to measure to what degree a text matches the classes covered by the training data. We demonstrate that the clauses provide a succinct interpretable description of known topics, and that our scoring mechanism makes it possible to discern novel topics from the known ones.

Even with Natural Language Processing approach, it limits with the absence of specific Named Entity recognizer to extract related entities of malware from unstructured data like text. It is essential to automate the process of extracting information such as Ransomware entity from text and the information extracted could be used as knowledge reasoning like profiling the behaviour of Ransomware using the information available on the Internet. Although the text itself is unstructured, informal text like Internet forum has its problems and challenges to perform the analysis and extraction process. Thus, the performance of machine learning in carrying out the classification of entities from this type of text depending on the complexity of the model. Therefore, this paper presents the comparison of few supervised learning techniques (CRF, Naive Bayes, and SVM) for model training in extracting Ransomware entities from unstructured text in terms of their performance. © 2019 IEEE.",entities; information; Ransomware; unstructured text,Character recognition; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Support vector machines; Text processing; entities; Extracting information; Extraction process; information; Knowledge reasoning; NAtural language processing; Problems and challenges; Unstructured texts; Malware,"Vadapalli, S.R., Hsieh, G., Nauer, K.S., Twitterosint, "" in (2018) Proceedings of International Conference Security and Management (SAM, pp. 220-226; Gharibshah, J., Inferip: Extracting actionable information from security discussion forums (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis andMining, ASONAM 2017; Macdonald, M., Frank, R., Mei, J., Monk, B., Identifying digital threats in a hacker web forum (2015) Proc. 2015IEEE/ACM Int.

An essential component of such a platform is the recommender systems that suggest the constituent user base, related tracks, albums and artists. In order to sustain such a recommender system, labeling data, to indicate which genre it belongs to is essential. Most recent academic publications that deal with music genre classification focus on the use of deep neural networks developed and applied within the music genre classification domain. This paper attempts to use some of the highly sophisticated techniques, such as Hierarchical Attention Networks that exist within the text classification domain in order to classify tracks of different genres. In order to do this, the music is first separated into different tracks (drums, vocals, bass and accompaniment) and converted into symbolic text data. Due to the sophistication of the distributed machine learning system present in this paper, it is capable of classifying contemporary genres with impressive accuracy, when comparing the results with that of competing classifiers. It is also argued that through the use text classification, the expert knowledge which musicians and people involved with musicological techniques, can be attracted to improving recommender systems within the music information retrieval research domain. © 2020 IEEE.",deep neural networks; distributed machine learning; hierarchical attention networks; mu- sic genre classification; music information retrieval; Online streaming; recommender systems,Classification (of information); Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Hierarchical systems; Information management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Online systems; Search engines; Text processing; Academic publications; Distributed machine learning; Expert knowledge; Genre classification; Music genre classification; Music information retrieval; NAtural language processing; Text classification; Recommender systems,"Zheng, E., Moh, M., Moh, T.-S., Music genre classification: A ngram based musicological approach (2017) 2017 IEEE 7th International Advance Computing Conference (IACC), pp. 671-677. , IEEE; Sridharan, A., Moh, M., Moh, T.-S., Similarity estimation for classical indian music (2018) 2018 17th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), pp. 814-819. , IEEE; Li, M., Sleep, R., Melody classification using a similarity metric based on kolmogorov complexity (2004) Sound and Music Computing, 2012; Kotsifakos, A., Kotsifakos, E.E., Papapetrou, P., Athitsos, V., Genre classification of symbolic music with smbgt (2013) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments, p. 44. , ACM; McKay, C., Fujinaga, I., Automatic genre classification using large high-level musical feature sets (2004) ISMIR 2004, pp. 525-530; Choi, K., Fazekas, G., Sandler, M., Cho, K., Convolutional recurrent neural networks for music classification (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 2392-2396. , IEEE; Dai, J., Liu, W., Ni, C., Dong, L., Yang, H., Multilingual deep neural network for music genre classification (2015) Sixteenth Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association; Jeong, I.-Y., Lee, K., Learning temporal features using a deep neural network and its application to music genre classification (2016) Ismir, pp. 434-440; Yang, Z., Yang, D., Dyer, C., He, X., Smola, A., Hovy, E., Hierarchical attention networks for document classification (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Associ-Ation for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pp. 1480-1489; Southall, C., Stables, R., Hockman, J., Automatic drum transcription using bi-directional recurrent neural networks (2016) ISMIR, pp. 591-597; Chandna, P., Miron, M., Janer, J., Gómez, E., Monoaural audio source separation using deep convolutional neural networks (2017) Inter-National Conference on Latent Variable Analysis and Signal Separation, pp. 258-266. , Springer; bzameknic, Musical Instrument Classification.

However, it is challenging to build QA systems which can learn to reason over knowledge graphs based on question-answer pairs alone. First, when people ask questions, their expressions are noisy (for example, typos in texts, or variations in pronunciations), which is non-trivial for the QA system to match those mentioned entities to the knowledge graph. Second, many questions require multi-hop logic reasoning over the knowledge graph to retrieve the answers. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and unified deep learning architecture, and an end-to-end variational learning algorithm which can handle noise in questions, and learn multi-hop reasoning simultaneously. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a recent benchmark dataset in the literature. We also derive a series of new benchmark datasets, including questions for multi-hop reasoning, questions paraphrased by neural translation model, and questions in human voice. Our method yields very promising results on all these challenging datasets. Copyright © 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The handwritten information is converted into digital form that is used as an input. Recognition is an attractive area of interest in research in recent years. There are good recognition system available for alphabetical and symbolic languages but for the language based on Arabic script like Urdu no such recognition system exist. The recognition is done either online or offline. For an online recognition system the input is taken through stylus or tablet whereas offline recognition is done by taking images through scanner. With the development in electronic tablets the movements of pen are captured accurately. Recognition of Urdu handwritten text is very complex task due to challenges in Urdu script. In this paper a survey is carried out on different Deep learning and statistical techniques for handwritten text recognition. © 2020 IEEE.,deep learning; ocr; recognition techniques,Deep learning; Surveys; Hand-written text recognition; Handwritten recognition; Machine learning approaches; Off-line recognition; On-line recognition; Recognition systems; Statistical techniques; Symbolic languages; Character recognition,"Khan, K.U., Online Urdu handwritten character recognition: Initial half form single stroke characters (2014) 2014 12th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology, , IEEE; Khan, K., Urdu text classification using decision trees (2015) 2015 12th International Conference on High-capacity Optical Networks and Enabling/Emerging Technologies (HONET), , IEEE; Setlur, S., (2009) Guide to OCR for Indic Scripts, , Ed.

In this paper, we have discussed how we can reduce the training time for deep learning models if we have already trained a model for a similar dataset. The basic logic here is that for similar dataset the features stored in the deep neural net are similar and the only difference comes for the classification layers of deep neural so instead of training the whole net we just train the last layers for classifying the data and use the trained model weights on the rest of the layers; this method saves a lot of time. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.",Deep learning; Machine learning; Natural language; Transfer learning model,Classification (of information); Computation theory; Deep neural networks; Intelligent computing; Neural networks; Transfer learning; Basic logic; Learning models; Model weights; Training time; Deep learning,"Lu, J., Behbood, V., Hao, P., Zuo, H., Xue, S., Zhang, G., Transfer learning using computational intelligence: a survey (2015) Knowl.-Based Syst, 80, pp. 14-23; Tan, C., Sun, F., Kong, T., Zhang, W., Yang, C., Liu, C., A survey on deep transfer learning (2018) International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks, pp. 270-279. , Springer, Cham; Sandeep, K.M., Prabhu, J., Recent development in big data analytics: research perspective (2018) Applications of Security, Mobile, Analytic, and Cloud (SMAC) Technologies for Effective Information Processing and Management.

Generally, these models are based on bag of words approaches, and therefore they do not fully capture the semantics of sentences which depends both by the semantics of the words, and their order in in the phrase. In this work we propose a sub-symbolic methodology to encode natural language sentences considering both these two aspects. The proposed approach exploits the properties of Geometric Algebra rotation operators, called rotors, to code sentences through the rotation of an orthogonal basis of a semantic space. The methodology is based on three main steps: the construction of a semantic space, the association of ad-hoc rotors to sentence bigrams, and finally the coding of the sentence through the application of the obtained rotors to a standard basis in the semantic space.

Most of the state-of-the-art RE systems rely on statistical machine learning techniques which usually employ an attribute-value representation of features. Contrarily to this trend, we focus on an alternative approach to RE based on the automatic induction of symbolic extraction rules. We present OntoILPER, an RE system based on Inductive Logic Programming which uses a domain ontology in its extraction process. Several experiments are discussed in this paper over the reACE 2004/2005 reference corpora.

A number of natural language processing (NLP) processes, viz. archival, retrieval, query response, information summarization, etc., highly rely on automatic classification of text documents. This has induced researchers to apply machine learning logic to automatically categorize documents based on languages and within documents belonging to the same language to devise methods to segregate them according to its contents. More than at present, 70% of the total text classification process involves ‘Preprocessing of text’, alone [1]. This indicates its importance of preprocessing and the efficiency based on text classification logic is solely dependent on an efficient preprocessing step.

The goal is to simplify and speed-up the process of robot adaptation to certain tasks, which are described in human language. We propose an approach, where semantic roles are attached to the components of instructions which lead to robotic execution. However, extraction of such roles from the sentence is not trivial due to the prevalent non determinism of human language. We propose algorithms for extracting actions and object names with roles and explain, how it leads to the robotic execution via attached sub-symbolic information of previous execution examples for rotor assembly and bio(technology) laboratory scenarios.

The chatbot KB is coded in a conceptual space induced from the application of the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) paradigm on a corpus of documents. LSA has the effect of decomposing the original relationships between elements into linearly-independent vectors. Each basis vector can be considered therefore as a ""conceptual coordinate"", which can be tagged by the words which better characterize it. This tagging is obtained by performing a (TF-IDF)-like weighting schema [3], that we call TW-ICW (term weight-inverse conceptual coordinate weight), to weigh the relevance of each term on each conceptual coordinate. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",,Knowledge based systems; Basis vector; Chatbots; ClIFFORD; Conceptual spaces; Knowledge base; Latent Semantic Analysis; Natural languages; Sub-symbolic; Semantics,"Landauer, T.K., Dumais, S.T., A Solution to Plato's Problem: The Latent Semantic Analysis Theory of the Acquisition, Induction, and Representation of Knowledge (1997) Psychological Review, 104 (2), pp. 211-240; Corpus Information, , http://lsa.colorado.edu/spaces.html, TASA; Baeza-Yates, B.-N.R., (1999) Modern Information Retrieval, , Addison Wesley; Croft, W.B., Lafferty, J., (2003) Language Modeling for Information Retrieval, , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht; Patyk-Lonska, A., Preserivng pieces of information in a given order in HRR and GAc (2011) Proceedings of the Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, pp. 213-220. , http://fedcsis.eucip.pl/proceedings/pliks/176.pdf, IEEE Press, Piscataway retrieved from; Plate, T., Holographic Reduced Representations (1995) IEEE Trans.

Clinical abbreviation disambiguation primarily determines the appropriate expanded form of an ambiguous clinical abbreviation activated by its context. Such information is very crucial for the improvement of precision in Clinical Natural Language Processing (CNLP) systems that discover implicit non trivial clinical information from narrative clinical text data in numerous settings. This paper explores the use of Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to truly understand the generalizability for clinical abbreviation disambiguation along with stability evaluation under different documents size obtained from the University of Minnesota-affiliated (UMN) Fairview Health Services in the Twin Cities.

However, text itself usually contains incomplete and ambiguous information, which makes necessity to leverage extra knowledge to understand it. Fortunately, text itself already contains well-defined morphological and syntactic knowledge; moreover, the large amount of texts on the Web enable the extraction of plenty of semantic knowledge. Therefore, it makes sense to design novel deep learning algorithms and systems in order to leverage the above knowledge to compute more effective word embeddings. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on the capacity of leveraging morphological, syntactic, and semantic knowledge to achieve high-quality word embeddings. Our study explores these types of knowledge to define new basis for word representation, provide additional input information, and serve as auxiliary supervision in deep learning, respectively. Experiments on an analogical reasoning task, a word similarity task, and a word completion task have all demonstrated that knowledge-powered deep learning can enhance the effectiveness of word embedding. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",,,"Bengio, Y., Ducharme, R., Vincent, P., Janvin, C., A neural probabilistic language model (2003) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 1137-1155; Bollacker, K., Evans, C., Paritosh, P., Sturge, T., Taylor, J., Freebase: A collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1247-1250. , ACM; Bordes, A., Weston, J., Collobert, R., Bengio, Y., Learning structured embeddings of knowledge bases (2011) AAAI; Collobert, R., Weston, J., A unified architecture for natural language processing: Deep neural networks with multitask learning (2008) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2008, pp. 160-167. , ACM, New York; Collobert, R., Weston, J., Bottou, L., Karlen, M., Kavukcuoglu, K., Kuksa, P., Natural language processing (almost) from scratch (2011) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 12, pp. 2493-2537; Deng, L., He, X., Gao, J., Deep stacking networks for information retrieval (2013) ICASSP, pp. 3153-3157; Finkelstein, L., Gabrilovich, E., Matias, Y., Rivlin, E., Solan, Z., Wolfman, G., Ruppin, E., Placing search in context: The concept revisited (2002) ACM Transactions on Information Systems; Glorot, X., Bordes, A., Bengio, Y., Domain adaptation for large-scale sentiment classification: A deep learning approach Proceedings of the Twenty-eight International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML (2011); Hinton, G.E., McClelland, J.L., Rumelhart, D.E., Distributed representations (1986) Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition, 3, pp. 1137-1155. , MIT Press; Huang, E., Socher, R., Manning, C., Ng, A., Improving word representations via global context and multiple word prototypes Proc. of ACL (2012); Huang, P.-S., He, X., Gao, J., Deng, L., Acero, A., Heck, L., Learning deep structured semantic models for web search using clickthrough data (2013) Proceedings of the 22Nd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information &38; Knowledge Management, CIKM 2013, pp. 2333-2338. , ACM, New York; Luong, M.-T., Socher, R., Manning, C.D., Better word representations with recursive neural networks for morphology (2013) CoNLL-2013, p. 104; Mikolov, T., (2012) Statistical Language Models Based on Neural Networks, , PhD thesis, Brno University of Technology; Mikolov, T., Chen, K., Corrado, G., Dean, J., (2013) Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space, , CoRR, abs/1301.3781; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G.S., Dean, J., Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality (2013) NIPS, pp. 3111-3119. , Burges, C.J.C., Bottou, L., Ghahramani, Z.,Weinberger, K.Q.

In this talk, I present an approach to tackle such phenomena by means of syntactic information. Our approach combines machine learning and symbolic processing: the former is used to obtain dependency trees for input sentences, and the latter to obtain the sentiment polarity for each sentence using handwritten rules that traverse the tree. Thanks to universal guidelines for syntactic annotation, our approach is applicable to multiple languages without rewriting the rules. Additionally, very accurate parsing is not needed for our approach to be helpful: fast and simple parsers will do, even if they lag behind state-of-the-art accuracy.

Some of the white-box techniques include: the use of constraint solvers for the automatic generation of test inputs at the white box level; the use of control flow graphs generated from code; and the use of path generation and symbolic execution to generate test inputs and test for path feasibility. Techniques such as boundary value analysis (BVA) may also be used for generating stronger test suites. However, for black box testing we rely on specifications or implicit requirements and spend considerable time and effort designing and executing test cases. This paper presents an approach that leverages natural language processing and machine learning techniques to capture black box system behavior in the form of constraints. Constraint solvers are then used to generate test cases using BVA and equivalence class partitioning. We also conduct a proof of concept that applies this approach to a simplified task management application and an enterprise job recruiting application. © 2019 IEEE.",Black box testing; Constraint solvers; Form crawling; GUI Testing; Machine learning; Natural language processing,Automatic programming; Equivalence classes; Flow graphs; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logic programming; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Software reliability; Automatic Generation; Boundary value analysis; Constraint solvers; Control flow graphs; GUI testing; Machine learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Natural language systems; Black-box testing,"Aamodt, A., Plaza, E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches (1994) AI Communications, 7 (1), pp. 39-59; Adamo, D., Alt, P., Briggs, K., Celli, N., Clarke, P.J., Daye, P., King, T.M., Santiago, D., (2019) Agent Source Code; Anand, S., Burke, E.K., Chen, T.Y., Clark, J., Cohen, M.B., Grieskamp, W., Harman, M., Bertolino, A., An orchestrated survey of methodologies for automated software test case generation (2013) Journal of Systems and Software, 86 (8), pp. 1978-2001; Arbon, J., AI for software testing (2017) Pacific NW Software Quality Conference.

However, each of them is based on a different rigid symbolic framework which makes it hard to use their data in other systems. It is unfortunate because such rich structured knowledge might lead to a huge leap forward in many other areas of AI like natural language processing (word-sense disambiguation, natural language understanding, ...), vision (scene classification, image semantic annotation, ...) or collaborative filtering. In this paper, we present a learning process based on an innovative neural network architecture designed to embed any of these symbolic representations into a more flexible continuous vector space in which the original knowledge is kept and enhanced. These learnt embeddings would allow data from any KB to be easily used in recent machine learning methods for prediction and information retrieval. We illustrate our method on WordNet and Freebase and also present a way to adapt it to knowledge extraction from raw text.

Concurrently, advances in artificial intelligence have made the coordination of many such agents possible. However, there is little work considering both the low-level reasoning that allows agents to interpret their environment, such as deep learning techniques, and the high-level reasoning that coordinates such agents. By considering both together, we can better handle real-world scenarios, for example by planning at a high level with low-level uncertainty in mind, or even by improving low-level processing by using high-level reasoning to place the agent in the best scenario for success. © 2019 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

Since the introduction of workable DL, numerous success stories have been widely reported: board games, autonomous driving vehicles, natural language translation, voice recognition, etc. However, for machines to exhibit a high degree of intelligence, they need more than the ability to learn. Indeed, heavy reliance on ML has resulted in widely publicized mishaps that negatively affect people in unexpected ways. For healthcare and other mission-critical applications, intelligent machines need to perform dependably to earn and maintain the trust of human users. To this end, it is necessary to take a holistic view toward AI, one that encompasses multiple facets of what constitutes intelligence. Specifically, this paper previews what thinking machines would be capable of by taking into consideration a machine's ability to abstract and reason, in addition to its ability to learn. © 2020 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; knowledge representation; machine intelligence; machine learning; machine thinking; reasoning system; semantic computing; telehealth,Health care; Medical computing; Turing machines; Autonomous driving; Board games; Holistic view; Human users; Intelligent machine; Mission critical applications; Natural languages; Telehealth; Deep learning,"Hopfield, J.J., Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities (1982) Proc.

This tool uses an action language ALM to perform inferences on complex interactions of events described in narratives. The methodology used to implement the TEXT2ALM system was originally outlined by Lierler, Inclezan, and Gelfond [13] via a manual process of converting a narrative to an ALM model. It relies on a conglomeration of resources and techniques from two distinct fields of artificial intelligence, namely, natural language processing and knowledge representation and reasoning. The effectiveness of system TEXT2ALM is measured by its ability to correctly answer questions from the bAbI tasks published by Facebook Research in 2015. This tool matched or exceeded the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning methods in six of the seven tested tasks. We also illustrate that the TEXT2ALM approach generalizes to a broader spectrum of narratives. © 2019 Open Publishing Association.

We collect human explanations for commonsense reasoning in the form of natural language sequences and highlighted annotations in a new dataset called Common Sense Explanations (CoS-E). We use CoS-E to train language models to automatically generate explanations that can be used during training and inference in a novel Commonsense Auto-Generated Explanation (CAGE) framework. CAGE improves the state-of-the-art by 10% on the challenging CommonsenseQA task. We further study commonsense reasoning in DNNs using both human and auto-generated explanations including transfer to out-of-domain tasks.

In this paper we focus on Facebook posts paired with “reactions” of multiple users, and we investigate their relationships with classes of emotions that are typically considered in the task of emotion detection. We are inspired by the idea of introducing a connection between reactions and emotions by means of First-Order Logic formulas, and we propose an end-to-end neural model that is able to jointly learn to detect emotions and predict Facebook reactions in a multi-task environment, where the logic formulas are converted into polynomial constraints. Our model is trained using a large collection of unsupervised texts together with data labeled with emotion classes and Facebook posts that include reactions. An extended experimental analysis that leverages a large collection of Facebook posts shows that the tasks of emotion classification and reaction prediction can both benefit from their interaction. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Emotion detection from text; Facebook reactions; Learning from Constraints,Forecasting; Formal logic; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Emotion classification; Emotion detection; Experimental analysis; Facebook; Learning from constraints; NAtural language processing; Reaction prediction; Social media datum; Social networking (online),"Agrawal, A., An, A., Unsupervised emotion detection from text using semantic and syntactic relations (2012) Proceedings of the International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology, Pp. 346–353.

To better understand a scientific topic, students need to compile information from multiple sources and determine the principal causal factors involved. We describe an approach for automatically inferring the quality and completeness of causal reasoning in essays on two separate scientific topics using a novel, twophase machine learning approach for detecting causal relations. For each core essay concept, we initially trained a window-based tagging model to predict which individual words belonged to that concept. Using the predictions from this first set of models, we then trained a second stacked model on all the predicted word tags present in a sentence to predict inferences between essay concepts. The results indicate we could use such a system to provide explicit feedback to students to improve reasoning and essay writing skills. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Argumentation; Causal relation; Machine learning; Natural language inference; Natural language processing; NLP; Reading,Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Education; Education computing; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Students; Argumentation; Causal relations; NAtural language processing; Natural languages; NLP; Reading; Learning systems,"Bengio, Y., Louradour, J., Collobert, R., Weston, J., Curriculum learning (2009) Proceedings of the 26Th Annual International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 41-48. , ACM; Blanco, E., Castell, N., Moldovan, D., Causal relation extraction (2008) LREC; Britt, M.A., Wiemer-Hastings, P., Larson, A., Perfetti, C., Using intelligent feedback to improve sourcing and integration in students’ essays (2004) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 14, pp. 359-374; Britt, M.A., Aglinskas, C., Improving students’ ability to identify and use source information (2002) Cognition and Instruction, 20 (4), pp. 485-522; Chi, M., Roscoe, R., Slotta, J., Roy, M., Chase, C., Misconceived causal explanations for emergent processes (2012) Cognitive Science, 36, pp. 1-61; Cohen, R., Analyzing the structure of argumentative discourse (1987) Computational Linguistics, 13 (1-2), pp. 11-24; (2010) Reading for Understanding across Grades 6 through 12: Evidence-Based Argumentation for Disciplinary Learning, , http://www.ies.ed.gov/ncer/projects/results.asp?ProgID=62&NameID-351, washington, d.c.: National center for education research, last accessed January 20, 2015; Girju, R., Moldovan, D., Mining answers for causation questions (2002) Proc.

Furthermore, black-box models achieving high predictive accuracy are widely used, yet the logic behind their predictions is often opaque.

Traditionally, “deep learning” is taken to be a learning process where the inference or optimization is based on the real-valued deterministic model. The “semantic structure” in words, sentences, entities, actions and documents drawn from a large vocabulary may not be well expressed or correctly optimized in mathematical logic or computer programs. The “distribution function” in discrete or continuous latent variable model for natural language may not be properly decomposed or estimated. This tutorial addresses the fundamentals of statistical models and neural networks, and focus on a series of advanced Bayesian models and deep models including hierarchical Dirichlet process [61], Chinese restaurant process [4], hierarchical Pitman-Yor process [60], Indian buffet process [35], recurrent neural network (RNN) [26, 41, 48, 65], long short-term memory, sequence-to-sequence model [59], variational auto-encoder (VAE) [44], generative adversarial network (GAN) [36], attention mechanism [27, 56], memory-augmented neural network [39, 58], skip neural network [6], temporal difference VAE [40], stochastic neural network [3, 47], stochastic temporal convolutional network [1], predictive state neural network [31], and policy neural network [49, 74]. Enhancing the prior/posterior representation is addressed [53, 62]. We present how these models are connected and why they work for a variety of applications on symbolic and complex patterns in natural language. The variational inference and sampling method are formulated to tackle the optimization for complicated models [54]. The word and sentence embeddings, clustering and co-clustering are merged with linguistic and semantic constraints. A series of case studies, tasks and applications are presented to tackle different issues in deep Bayesian mining, searching, learning and understanding. At last, we will point out a number of directions and outlooks for future studies. This tutorial serves the objectives to introduce novices to major topics within deep Bayesian learning, motivate and explain a topic of emerging importance for data mining and natural language understanding, and present a novel synthesis combining distinct lines of machine learning work. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Bayesian learning; Data mining; Deep learning; Information retrieval; Natural language processing,Bayesian networks; Character recognition; Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Data mining; Deep learning; Distribution functions; Image segmentation; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Recommender systems; Recurrent neural networks; Semantics; Speech recognition; Speech transmission; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Text mining; Websites; Bayesian learning; Hierarchical Dirichlet process; Learning and understanding; NAtural language processing; Natural language understanding; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Sentiment classification; Stochastic neural network; Learning systems,"Aksan, E., Hilliges, O., STCN: Stochastic temporal convolutional networks (2019) Proc.

The intermingling of techniques in areas such as natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning, data mining, and knowledge representation provide a lot of possibilities for development of ontology learning approaches. A rise in focus on the ability to cope with the scale of Web data required for ontology learning forces the potential growth of cross-language research, emphasizing the automatic or semi-automatic generation of the tools dedicated to text mining and information extraction. This paper presents the integration of ontology learning tools from text in the knowledge repository to incorporate the applied techniques and outputs of an ontology learning algorithm into the one complex multifunctional solution. The proposed knowledge repository covers various applicability of existing techniques of learning ontologies from text, and offers competency question-based reasoning mechanism for individuals to specify their profiles of ontology learning tools. The validation stage is also provided in the form of applied reasoning. © 2019 The Author(s).

With the rising of deep learning techniques, algorithmic models rival human performances on simple QA, and thus increasingly challenging machine reading datasets have been proposed. Though various challenges such as evidence integration and commonsense knowledge have been integrated, one of the fundamental capabilities in human reading, namely logical reasoning, is not fully investigated. We build a comprehensive dataset, named LogiQA, which is sourced from expert-written questions for testing human Logical reasoning. It consists of 8,678 QA instances, covering multiple types of deductive reasoning. Results show that state-of-the-art neural models perform by far worse than human ceiling. Our dataset can also serve as a benchmark for re-investigating logical AI under the deep learning NLP setting.

We propose an automatic approach to analyze the perceived intentions behind public tweets. Our long-term goal is to create high-level, behavioral models of the health information consumers and disseminators, relevant to studies in narrative medicine and health information dissemination. The contributions of this paper are: (1) a validated intention taxonomy, derived from pragmatics and empirically adjusted to Twitter public communication; (2) a tagged healthrelated corpus of 1100 tweets; (3) an effective approach to automatically discover intentions from text, using supervised machine learning with discourse features only, independent of domain vocabulary. Reasoning on the results, we claim the transferability of our solution to other healthcare corpora, enabling thus more extensive studies in the concerned domains. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Classification; Intention mining; Linguistics; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Speech acts; Text mining; Twitter,Classification (of information); Data mining; Education; Health; Health care; Information dissemination; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Public health; Social networking (online); Speech analysis; Text processing; Automatic approaches; Effective approaches; On-line communication; Public communications; Speech acts; Supervised machine learning; Text mining; Twitter; Artificial intelligence,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organ.

Social networking is an invaluable medium for individuals to express their thoughts and views about any subject or topic, contributing to massive quantities of unstructured knowledge. These emotions can be processed and examined to analyze and obtain insights. Therefore, several machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods were used to examine these opinions. Because of the shifts in the sequential order, stream lengths, and complex logic, the exact sentiments in the consumer feedback are still difficult. Recently, deep learning methods have been used to attain improved results. The most common forms of deep learning method used are the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Long short-term memory (LSTM), particularly with attentive layers, pays greater focus to the sentiment impact. LSTM has an advantage over alternative RNNs and other deep learning approaches because of relative insensitivity to gap length. Deep learning approaches have better accuracy over existing state-of-the-art approaches because of their ability to handle extensive realtime data and the power of feature extraction, but there is still room for improvement. This paper has used Long Short-Term Model (LSTM) model to predict the customer review's opinion, attaining an accuracy of 93.66%. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the deep LSTM model with existing has been presented. © 2021 IEEE.",Deep Learning; LSTM; Machine Learning; Sentiment Analysis,Behavioral research; Convolutional neural networks; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Sentiment analysis; Comparative analysis; Learning approach; Learning methods; Massive quantities; NAtural language processing; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Sequential ordering; State-of-the-art approach; Deep learning,"Bose, R., Dey, R.K., Roy, S., Sarddar, D., Analyzing political sentiment using twitter data (2019) Information and Communication Technology for Intelligent Systems, pp. 427-436. , Springer; Mudinas, A., Zhang, D., Levene, M., (2019) Market Trend Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis: Lessons Learned and Paths Forward; Barry, J., Sentiment analysis of online reviews using bag-of-words and lstm approaches (2017) Aics, pp. 272-274; Habimana, O., Li, Y., Li, R., Gu, X., Yu, G., Sentiment analysis using deep learning approaches: An overview (2020) Sci.

However, since language is often discrete and the space for all sentences is infinite, there are many challenges for formulating reinforcement learning problems of NLP tasks. In this tutorial, we provide a gentle introduction to the foundation of deep reinforcement learning, as well as some practical DRL solutions in NLP. We describe recent advances in designing deep reinforcement learning for NLP, with a special focus on generation, dialogue, and information extraction.

The content of a medical guideline is based on a systematic review of clinical evidence with instructions and recommendations that clinicians can refer to. Most of the guidelines are available in an unstructured text format. Hence, clinicians must take a considerable time to search and find relevant recommendations in their semantic context. Using Machine Learning algorithms, automatic information extraction from medical guidelines has recently become possible. We present a novel system for information extraction and a fuzzy rule database developed for clinical guidelines. The proposed system, dubbed NLP-FUZZY, combines capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Fuzzy Logic approaches. First, the NLP-FUZZY performs a semantic extraction of medical guidelines using a bi-directional Long short-term memory (LSTM). Subsequently, using the extracted semantic, it creates fuzzy rules, which are able to recognize new cases in a learning domain while predicting and extract the grade of recommendation. In order to test the NLP-FUZZY system, we compared its performance with state-of-the-art NLP approaches for clinical information extraction. © 42nd International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics, MIPRO 2019 - Proceedings.

In recent years, many studies have focused on sentiment classification in the context of machine learning, e.g. to identify that a sentiment is positive or negative. In particular, the bag-of-words method has been popularly used to transform textual data into structured data, in order to enable the direct use of machine learning algorithms for sentiment classification. Through the bag-of-words method, each single term in a text document is turned into a single attribute to make up a structured data set, which results in high dimensionality of the data set and thus negative impact on the interpretability of computational models for sentiment analysis. This paper proposes the use of fuzzy rule based systems as computational models towards accurate and interpretable analysis of sentiments. The use of fuzzy logic is better aligned with the inherent uncertainty of language, while the 'white box' characteristic of the rule based learning approaches leads to better interpretability of the results. The proposed approach is tested on four datasets containing movie reviews; the aim is to compare its performance in terms of accuracy with two other approaches for sentiment analysis that are known to perform very well. The results indicate that the fuzzy rule based approach performs marginally better than the well-known machine learning techniques, while reducing the computational complexity and increasing the interpretability. © 2017 IEEE.",data mining; fuzzy rule based systems; machine learning; sentiment analysis; text classification,Artificial intelligence; Character recognition; Classification (of information); Computation theory; Computational methods; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy rules; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Computational model; High dimensionality; Machine learning techniques; Rule-based learning; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Text classification; Use of fuzzy logic; Data mining,"Reynolds, K., Kontostathis, A., Edwards, L., Using machine learning to detect cyberbullying (2011) Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, pp. 241-244. , Dec; Tripathy, A., Agrawal, A., Rath, S.K., Classification of sentimental reviews using machine learning techniques (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 57, pp. 821-829; Sivic, J., Efficient visual search of videos cast as text retrieval (2009) IEEE Trans.

In this work, we look at augmenting baseline features with lexical representations that are derived from text, providing continuous embeddings of the lexicon in a lower-dimensional space. Although learned in an unsupervised fashion, such features capture semantic and syntactic properties that make them amenable for prosody prediction.

In response to that challenge the article proposes a computationally adequate method for design of a neural network capable of performing an important group of symbolic operations on a sub-symbolic level without initial learning: extraction of elements of a given structure, conditional branching and construction of a new structure. The neural network primitive infers on distributed representations of symbolic structures and represents a proof of concept for the viability of implementation of symbolic rules in a neural pipeline for various tasks like language analysis or aggregation of linguistic assessments during the decision making process. The proposed method was practically implemented and evaluated within the Keras framework. The network designed was tested for a particular case of transforming active-passive sentences represented in parsed grammatical structures. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Artificial neural networks; Linguistic decision making; Natural language processing; Tensor product representations,Decision making; Design; Decision making process; Distributed representation; Grammatical structure; Language analysis; Linguistic assessment; Neural network designs; Structural transformation; Symbolic operations; Neural networks,"Abadi, M., (2015) TensorFlow: large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems, , http://tensorflow.org/.Softwareavailablefromtensorflow.org; Besold, T.R., (2017) Neural-symbolic learning and reasoning: a survey and interpretation, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03902; Besold, T.R., Kühnberger, K.U., Towards integrated neural-symbolic systems for human-level AI: two research programs helping to bridge the gaps (2015) Biol.

From assembly language to present day’s object-oriented programming, concepts came to make programming easier so that a programmer can focus on the logic and the architecture rather than the code and language itself. To go a step further in this journey of removing human-computer language barrier, this paper proposes machine learning approach using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) to convert human language into programming language code. The programmer will write expressions for codes in layman’s language, and the machine learning model will translate it to the targeted programming language. The proposed approach yields result with 74.40% accuracy. This can be further improved by incorporating additional techniques, which are also discussed in this paper. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",LSTM; Machine learning; Machine translation; NLP; RNN; Text to code,Ada (programming language); Brain; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Computer systems programming; Learning systems; Machine learning; Object oriented programming; Assembly language; LSTM; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning models; Machine translations; Natural languages; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Text to code; Long short-term memory,"Allamanis, M., Barr, E.T., Devanbu, P., Sutton, C., (2017) A Survey of Machine Learning for Big Code and Naturalness., , http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06182; Birch, A., Osborne, M., Koehn, P., Predicting success in machine translation (2008) In: Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing-Emnlp, 2008, pp. 745-754. , https://doi.org/10.3115/1613715.1613809, pp., October; George, D., Priyanka Girase, N., Mahesh Gupta, N., Prachi Gupta, N., Aakanksha Sharma, N., Navi, V., Programming language inter-conversion (2010) Int.

Traditionally, “deep learning” is taken to be a learning process where the inference or optimization is based on the real-valued deterministic model. The “semantic structure” in words, sentences, entities, actions and documents drawn from a large vocabulary may not be well expressed or correctly optimized in mathematical logic or computer programs. The “distribution function” in discrete or continuous latent variable model for natural language may not be properly decomposed or estimated. This tutorial addresses the fundamentals of statistical models and neural networks, and focus on a series of advanced Bayesian models and deep models including hierarchical Dirichlet process, Chinese restaurant process, hierarchical Pitman-Yor process, Indian buffet process, recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory, sequence-to-sequence model, variational auto-encoder (VAE), generative adversarial network (GAN), attention mechanism, memory-augmented neural network, skip neural network, stochastic neural network, predictive state neural network, policy neural network. We present how these models are connected and why they work for a variety of applications on symbolic and complex patterns in natural language. The variational inference and sampling method are formulated to tackle the optimization for complicated models. The word and sentence embeddings, clustering and co-clustering are merged with linguistic and semantic constraints. A series of case studies are presented to tackle different issues in deep Bayesian mining, learning and understanding. At last, we will point out a number of directions and outlooks for future studies. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Bayesian learning; Deep learning; Natural language processing,Bayesian networks; Character recognition; Classification (of information); Data mining; Distribution functions; Image segmentation; Information retrieval systems; Natural language processing systems; Recurrent neural networks; Semantics; Speech recognition; Speech transmission; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Text processing; Bayesian learning; Hierarchical Dirichlet process; Latent variable modeling; Learning and understanding; NAtural language processing; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Sentiment classification; Stochastic neural network; Deep learning,"Chien, J.-T., Hierarchical Pitman-yor-Dirichlet language model (2015) IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 23 (8), pp. 1259-1272. , 2015; Chien, J.-T., Laplace group sensing for acoustic models (2015) IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 23 (5), pp. 909-922. , 2015; Chien, J.-T., Hierarchical theme and topic modeling (2016) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 27 (3), pp. 565-578. , 2016; Chien, J.-T., Bayesian nonparametric learning for hierarchical and sparse topics (2018) IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 26 (2), pp. 422-435. , 2018; Chien, J.-T., Chang, Y.-L., Bayesian sparse topic model (2014) Journal of Signal Processing Systems, 74 (3), pp. 375-389. , 2014; Chien, J.-T., Chueh, C.-H., Dirichlet class language models for speech recognition (2011) IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 19 (3), pp. 482-495. , 2011; Chien, J.-T., Chueh, C.-H., Topic-based hierarchical segmentation (2012) IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 20 (1), pp. 55-66. , 2012; Chien, J.-T., Ku, Y.-C., Bayesian recurrent neural network for language modeling (2016) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 27 (2), pp. 361-374. , 2016; Chien, J.-T., Kuo, K.-T., Variational recurrent neural networks for speech separation (2017) Proc.

Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) using serverless computing paradigm provides high performance and low cost solutions for deploying such applications on cloud while minimizing the operational logic. Using FaaS for efficient deployment of complex applications, such as natural language processing (NLP) and image processing, containing large deep learning models will be an advantage. However, constrained resources and stateless nature of FaaS offers numerous challenges while deploying such applications. In this work, we discuss the methodological suggestions and their implementation for deploying pre-trained large size machine learning and deep learning models on FaaS. We also evaluate the performance and deployment cost of an enterprise application, consisting of suite of deep vision preprocessing algorithms and models, on VM and FaaS platform. Our evaluation shows that migration from monolithic to FaaS platform significantly improves the performance of the application at a reduced cost. © 2020 IEEE.",AI; cloud; FaaS; serverless,,"Chahal, D., Ojha, R., Choudhury, S.R., Nambiar, M., Migrating a recommendation system to cloud using ml workflow (2020) Companion of the ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering, Ser.

A visual understanding of the problem at hand can be very useful for the comprehension of the problem. We present a system VisualMath that uses machine learning tools and crafted visual logic to automatically generate appropriate visualizations from the text of the word-problems and solve it. We demonstrate the improvements in the understanding of math word-problems by conducting a user study and learning of meaning of relevant new words by students.

A number of middleware architectures, frameworks and programming languages exist for implementing algorithms on robots. Also, efforts have been made to enable robots to understand the multitude of natural languages available. Nevertheless, there is definite lack of intermediary languages for the representation of symbol grounding mechanisms in robots and standards for inter-robot cognitive communication. We address this void by presenting an intermediary meta-language based on a perceptually grounded algorithmic alphabet - the Affordance and kTR Augmented Alphabet based Neuro-Symbolic language, in short Af-kTRAANS, yielding an abstract layer sandwiched between the natural and the programming language layers that robots can use for knowledge representation, sharing and communication, while being agnostic to the embodiment, the pertinent human language, as well as, socio-cultural contexts and environments. Based on the k-TR theory of cognitive visual perception and implemented for practical systems using the Affordance Network (AfNet) and the AfRob ontology, the graphical language can support a wide variety of object definition phrases as well as action verbs/ object interaction commands while providing the necessary succinctness for tractable modeling. The various aspects of this cognitive inter-robot communication language are presented in this paper. Several examples of usage of the graphical language for common robotic task based queries are demonstrated along with the grounding mechanisms. © 2015 IEEE.",,Algorithmic languages; Cognitive systems; Computational linguistics; Data communication equipment; Knowledge representation; Man machine systems; Middleware; Modeling languages; Robot programming; Robotics; Robots; Visual languages; Cognitive communications; Cognitive visual perceptions; Graphical languages; Human robot Interaction (HRI); Inter-robot communication; Middleware architecture; Object interactions; Sociocultural context; Human robot interaction,"Schlemmer, M.J., Vincze, M., Theoretic foundations of situating cognitive vision in robots and cognitive systems Journal Image and Vision Computing; Tenorth, M., Beetz, M., Knowrob-knowledge processing for autonomous personal robots (2009) IROS; Pangercic, D., Tenorth, M., Jain, D., Beetz, M., Combining perception and knowledge processing for everyday manipulation (2010) IROS; Solina, F., Bajcsy, R., Recovery of parametric models from range images (1990) PAMI; Varadarajan, K.M., Vincze, M., Real-time quadric fitting for point cloud parametrization using particle convergence (2012) CVPR W; Varadarajan, K.M., Vincze, M., Object part segmentation and classification in range images for grasping (2011) ICAR; Raju, C., Varadarajan, K.M., Krishnamurthi, N., Xu, S., Biederman, I., Kelly, T., (2010) Cognitive Object Recognition System, , Perception, Unmanned Systems Technology, SPIE; Biederman, I., Cooper, E., Geon theory as an account of shape recognition in mind (1993) Brain, and Machine, BMVC; www.theaffordances.net, AfNet; K-TR: Karmic Tabula Rasa: A theory of visual perception (2011) International Society for Psychophysics, (ISP); Winston, P.H., Binford, T.O., Katz, B., Lowry, M., (1984) Learning Physical Description from Functional Definitions, Examples, and Precedents, , MIT Press; Stark, L., Bowyer, K., Achieving generalized object recognition through reasoning about association of function to structure (1991) PAMI; Rivlin, E., Dickinson, S.J., Rosenfeld, A., Recognition by functional parts (1995) CVIU; Varadarajan, K.M., Vincze, M., AfNet: The affordance network (2012) ACCV; Varadarajan, K.M., Vincze, M., AfRob: The affordance network ontology for robots (2012) IROS; Varadarajan, K.M., Potapova, E., Vincze, M., Attention driven grasping for clearing aheap ofobjects (2012) IROS; WikiHow. com; McDermott, D., PDDL-the planning domain definition language (1998) Tech RepCVC TR-98-003/DCS TR-1165; Varadarajan, K.M., Vincze, M., 4D space-time mereo-topo-geometry-part connectivity calculus for visual object representation (2014) ICPR; Backus, J.W., The syntax and semantics of the proposed international algebraic language of the Zurich ACM-GAMM Conference (1959) Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Processing.

Key elements of the TFM are functional characteristics of the system and cause-effect relations between them. Natural Language Processing (NLP) can help in automatic processing of textual descriptions of functionality of the domain. The current research illustrates results of a survey of research papers on identification and extracting cause-effect relations from text using NLP and other techniques. The survey shows that expression of cause-effect relations in text can be very different. Sometimes the same language constructs indicate both causal and non-causal relations. Hybrid solutions that use machine learning, ontologies, linguistic and syntactic patterns as well as temporal reasoning show better results in extracting and filtering cause-effect pairs. Multi cause and multi effect domains still are not very well studied. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Since foundational work in Natural Language Understanding has shown that a deep semantic approach is still not feasible, current research is focused on shallow methods combining linguistic models and machine learning techniques. The latter aim at learning semantic models, like those that can detect the entailment between the meaning of two text fragments, by means of training examples described by specific features. These are rather difficult to design since there is no linguistic model that can effectively encode the lexico-syntactic level of a sentence and its corresponding semantic models. Thus, the adopted solution consists in exhaustively describing training examples by means of all possible combinations of sentence words and syntactic information. The latter, typically expressed as parse trees of text fragments, is often encoded in the learning process using graph algorithms. In this paper, we propose a class of graphs, the tripartite directed acyclic graphs (tDAGs), which can be efficiently used to design algorithms for graph kernels for semantic natural language tasks involving sentence pairs. These model the matching between two pairs of syntactic trees in terms of all possible graph fragments. Interestingly, since tDAGs encode the association between identical or similar words (i.e. variables), it can be used to represent and learn first-order rules, i.e. rules describable by first-order logic. We prove that our matching function is a valid kernel and we empirically show that, although its evaluation is still exponential in the worst case, it is extremely efficient and more accurate than the previously proposed kernels.",,Directed acyclic graphs; First order logic; First-order; Graph algorithms; Graph kernels; ITS evaluation; Learning process; Learning semantics; Linguistic models; Machine learning techniques; Matching functions; NAtural language processing; Natural language understanding; Natural languages; Parse trees; Research areas; Semantic approach; Semantic Model; Syntactic information; Syntactic trees; Text fragments; Textual entailment; Training example; Worst case; Character recognition; Computational linguistics; Encoding (symbols); Engineering research; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Plant extracts; Syntactics; Trees (mathematics); Semantics,"Aizerman, A., Braverman, E.M., Rozoner, L.I., Theoretical foundations of the potential function method in pattern recognition learning (1964) Automation and Remote Control, 25, pp. 821-837; Bar-Haim, R., Dagan, I., Dolan, B., Ferro, L., Giampiccolo, D., Magnini, B.S.I., The Second pascal recognising textual entailment challenge (2006) Proceedings of the Second PASCAL Challenges Workshop on Recognising Textual Entailment, , Venice, Italy; Carpenter, B., (1992) The Logic of Typed Feature Structures, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England; Charniak, E., A maximum-entropy-inspired parser (2000) Proc. of the 1st NAACL, , Seattle, Washington; Chierchia, G., McConnell-Ginet, S., (2001) Meaning and Grammar: An Introduction to Semantics, , MIT press, Cambridge, MA; Chomsky, N., (1957) Aspect of Syntax Theory, , MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachussetts; Collins, M., Head-driven statistical models for natural language parsing (2003) Computational Linguistics, 29 (4), pp. 589-637. , DOI 10.1162/089120103322753356; Collins, M., Duffy, N., New ranking algorithms for parsing and tagging: Kernels over discrete structures, and the voted perceptron (2002) Proceedings of ACL02; Corley, C., Mihalcea, R., Measuring the semantic similarity of texts (2005) Proc. of the ACL Workshop on Empirical Modeling of Semantic Equivalence and Entailment, Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 13-18. , Ann Arbor, Michigan June; Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20, pp. 1-25; Cristianini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J., (2000) An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods, , Cambridge University Press, March ISBN 0521780195; Dagan, I., Glickman, O., Probabilistic textual entailment: Generic applied modeling of language variability (2004) Proceedings of the Workshop on Learning Methods for Text Understanding and Mining, , Grenoble, France; Dagan, I., Glickman, O., Magnini, B., The pascal recognising textual entailment challenge (2006) LNAI 3944: MLCW 2005, , (Q.-C. et al., Ed. ), Springer-Verlag, Milan, Italy; Dang, H.T., Overview of DUC 2005 (2005) Proceedings of the 2005 Document Understanding Workshop; Eisner, J., Learning non-isomorphictreemappings formachine translation (2003) Proceedings of the 41st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), , Companion Volume, Sapporo, July; G̈artner, T., A survey of kernels for structured data (2003) SIGKDD Explorations; Gildea, D., Jurafsky, D., Automatic labeling of semantic roles (2002) Computational Linguistics, 28 (3), pp. 245-288; Grinberg, D., Lafferty, J., Sleator, D., A robust parsing algorithm for link grammar (1996) 4th International Workshop on Parsing Tecnologies, , Prague; Haghighi, A.D., Ng, A.Y., Manning, C.D., Robust textual inference via graph matching (2005) HLT '05: Proceedings of the Conference on Human Language Technology and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Association for Computational Linguistics, , Morristown, NJ, USA; Harabagiu, S., Hickl, A., Methods for using textual entailment in open-domain question answering (2006) Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 44th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, , Association for Computational Linguistics, Sydney, Australia July; Harabagiu, S., Hickl, A., Lacatusu, F., Satisfying information needs with multi-document summaries (2007) Information Processing and Management, 43 (6), pp. 1619-1642. , DOI 10.1016/j.ipm.2007.01.004, PII S030645730700026X; Hickl, A., Williams, J., Bensley, J., Roberts, K., Rink, B., Shi, Y., Recognizing textual entailmentwith lccs groundhog system (2006) Proceedings of the Second PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge, , (B.

We focused the IMD processing at the low level of discourse. In this paper, we proposed the preprocessing phase before the IMD structure analysis within the context of Controlled Natural Language (CNL). Our contribution is defined in context of the IMD processing and the use of machine learning; first, we present a CNL, a pure corpus and Matemathical Treebank for processing IMD; second, we present a preprocessing phase for IMD analysis with connectives disambiguation and verbs treatment, finally, we found a satisfactory result on input text parsing using a statistical parsing model. We will propagate these results for classification of argumentative informal practices via the low level discourse in IMD processing. © 2012 ACM.",connective tagging; controlled natural language; corpus; informal mathematical discourse; statistical parsing,connective tagging; Controlled natural language; corpus; informal mathematical discourse; statistical parsing; Computer applications; Knowledge management,"Beis, A., Ferguson, M., Katz, K., Mac-Intire, R., (1995) Bracketing Guidelines for Treebank II Style: Penn Treebank Project, , University of Pennsylvania; Bikel, D.M., Design of a multilingual, parallel processing statistical parsing engine (2002) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Human Language Technology Research HLT'02, pp. 178-182. , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.

Even though these experts are an integral part of the modeling process, they are human and cannot always provide the amounts of information that is needed. To that effect, the idea behind this thesis research is to utilize the data's struc-ture to extract relationships between knowledge entities in cases where expert knowledge is not enough. The goal is to automatically model the similarity measure between cases and their attributes using methods such as information retrieval (IR), natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, graph theory, and social network analysis (SNA), with an emphasis on SNA, to extract contextual knowledge from a dataset.

In this paper, we describe a dataset and baseline results for a question answering system that utilizes web tables. The dataset is derived from commonly asked questions on the web, and their corresponding answers found in tables on websites. Our dataset is novel in that every question is paired with a table of a different signature, so learning must automatically generalize across domains. Each QA training instance comprises a table, a natural language question, and a corresponding structured SQL query. We build our model by dividing question answering into a sequence of tasks, including table retrieval and question element classification, and conduct experiments to measure the performance of each task. In a traditional machine learning design manner, we extract various features specific to each task, apply a neural model, and then compose a full pipeline which constructs the SQL query from its parts. Our work provides quantitative results and error analysis for each task, and identifies in detail the reasoning required to generate SQL expressions from natural language questions. This analysis of reasoning informs future models based on neural machine learning. © 2019 ACM.",,Information management; Machine learning; Query processing; Baseline results; Data-sources; Future models; Natural language questions; Neural modeling; Quantitative result; Question Answering; Question answering systems; Natural language processing systems,"Bird, S., Klein, E., Loper, E., (2009) Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit, , O'Reilly Media, Inc; Bordawekar, R., Shmueli, O., (2016) Enabling Cognitive Intelligence Queries in Relational Databases Using Low-dimensional Word Embeddings; Chen, D., Fisch, A., Weston, J., Bordes, A., Reading wikipedia to answer open-domain questions (2017) Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 1870-1879. , July; Cheng, J., Reddy, S., Saraswat, V., Lapata, M., Learning structured natural language representations for semantic parsing (2017) Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 44-55. , July; Gardiner, S., Tomasic, A., Zimmerman, J., Smartwrap: Seeing datasets with the crowd's eyes (2015) Proceedings of the 12th Web for All Conference, p. 3; Hayati, S.A., Olivier, R., Avvaru, P., Yin, P., Tomasic, A., Neubig, G., Retrieval-based neural code generation (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 925-930. , Oct.-Nov; Jauhar, S.K., Turney, P., Hovy, E., Tables as semi-structured knowledge for question answering (2016) Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), 1, pp. 474-483; Karki, B., Hu, F., Haridas, N., Barot, S., Liu, Z., Callebert, L., Grabmair, M., Tomasic, A., (2019) Question Answering Via Web Extracted Tables and Pipelined Models, , https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07113, arXiv preprint; Li, X., Roth, D., Learning question classifiers (2002) Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics - Volume 1, COLING'02, pp. 1-7. , Stroudsburg, PA, USA; Pasupat, P., Liang, P., Compositional semantic parsing on semi-structured tables (2015) Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 1470-1480. , July; Pennington, J., Socher, R., Manning, C., Glove: Global vectors for word representation (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1532-1543; Ramos, J.E., Using tf-idf to determine word relevance in document queries (2003) Proceedings of the First Instructional Conference on Machine Learning; Srihari, W.N.I.W.N., Li, R., (1999) Information Extraction Supported Question Answering, , Defense Technical Information Center, Accession Number: ADA460042; Sutskever, I., Vinyals, O., Le, Q.V., Sequence to sequence learning with neural networks (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3104-3112; Tayyar Madabushi, H., Lee, M., High accuracy rule-based question classification using question syntax and semantics (2016) Proceedings of COLING 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers, pp. 1220-1230. , Dec; Waltz, D.L., An english language query answering system for a large relational data base (1978) Communications of the ACM, 21 (7), pp. 526-539; Zhong, V., Xiong, C., Socher, R., (2017) Seq2sql: Generating Structured Queries from Natural Language Using Reinforcement Learning, , CoRR, abs/1709.00103",,ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD),Association for Computing Machinery,"2nd International Workshop on Exploiting Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Data Management, aiDM 2019 - In conjunction with the 2019 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference",5 July 2019,,152467,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074455203

The extensions first required new sentence templates. Next, changes to a GPSG parser modified its lexicon, and then extended its parsing and logical form rules to allow user-defined spatial and temporal constraints to be extracted. The sentence templates ground user-defined culturally-specific times and places to boundaries surrounding prototypical ideals. Query points, defined by location and time, are compared to these definitions using Gaussians centered at prototypical 'ideal' times or places. The Gaussians provide soft fall-off at the boundaries. Fuzzy logic operators allow larger expressions to be interpreted, analogous to Boolean combinations of terms. The mathematically-interpreted spatiotemporal terms act as domain features for a machine learning algorithm. They allow easy specification (compared to programming) of basis functions for an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm that detects anomalous vehicle tracks or suspicious agent behavior. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",anomaly detection; controlled natural language; CPL; fuzzy logic; GPSG parsing; inverse reinforcement learning; spatiotemporal reasoning,Computer circuits; Computer programming languages; Context free grammars; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; Syntactics; Web crawler; Anomaly detection; Controlled natural language; GPSG parsing; Inverse reinforcement learning; Spatio-temporal reasoning; Fuzzy logic,"Murray, W.R., Singliar, T., Spatiotemporal extensions to a controlled natural language (2012) CNL 2012.

While most of the current solutions to vision-to-language problems are inspired from machine translation methods, aiming to directly map visual features to text, several recent results on image and video understanding have proven the importance of specifically and formally representing the semantic content of a visual scene, before reasoning over it and mapping it to natural language. This paper proposes a deep learning solution to the problem of generating structured descriptions for videos, and evaluates it on a dataset of formally annotated videos, which has been automatically generated as part of this work. The recorded results confirm the potential of the solution, indicating that it manages to describe the semantic content in a video scene with a similar accuracy to the one of state-of-the-art natural language captioning models. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",Structured video captioning; Video understanding,Deep learning; Distributed computer systems; Multi agent systems; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Automatically generated; Knowledge extraction; Machine translation methods; Natural languages; Question Answering; Structured video; Video annotations; Video understanding; Visual languages,"Anderson, P., Fernando, B., Johnson, M., Gould, S., SPICE: Semantic propositional image caption evaluation (2016) LNCS, 9909, pp. 382-398. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46454-124, Leibe, B., Matas, J., Sebe, N., Welling, M.

We demonstrate HEIDL, a prototype HITLML system that exposes the machine-learned model through high-level, explainable linguistic expressions formed of predicates representing semantic structure of text. In HEIDL, human's role is elevated from simply evaluating model predictions to interpreting and even updating the model logic directly by enabling interaction with rule predicates themselves. Raising the currency of interaction to such semantic levels calls for new interaction paradigms between humans and machines that result in improved productivity for text analytics model development process. Moreover, by involving humans in the process, the human-machine co-created models generalize better to unseen data as domain experts are able to instill their expertise by extrapolating from what has been learned by automated algorithms from few labelled data. © 2019 All rights reserved.",,Computational linguistics; Semantics; Automated algorithms; Evaluating models; Human-in-the-loop; Interaction paradigm; Linguistic expressions; Machine learning communities; Model development; Semantic structures; Deep learning,"Bernstein, M.S., Little, G., Miller, R.C., Hartmann, B., Ackerman, M.S., Karger, D.R., Crowell, D., Panovich, K., Soylent: A word processor with a crowd inside UIST; Chen, N., Suh, J., Verwey, J., Ramos, G., Drucker, S., Simard, P., Anchorviz: Facilitating classifier error discovery through interactive semantic data exploration IUI; Cohen, W.W., Yang, F., Rivard Mazaitis, K., Tensorlog: Deep learning meets probabilistic dbs (2017) CoRR; Evans, R., Grefenstette, E., Learning explanatory rules from noisy data (2018) JAIR; Hanafi, M.F., Abouzied, A., Chiticariu, L., Li, Y., Synthesizing extraction rules from user examples with seer (2017) SIGMOD; Jiang, Y., Finegan-Dollak, C., Kummerfeld, J.K., Lasecki, W., Effective crowdsourcing for a new type of summarization task NAACL; Kim, J., Cheng, J., Bernstein, M.S., Ensemble: Exploring complementary strengths of leaders and crowds in creative collaboration CSCW; Krishnamurthy, R., Li, Y., Raghavan, S., Reiss, F., Vaithyanathan, S., Zhu, H., Systemt: A system for declarative information extraction (2009) SIGMOD Record.; Lasecki, W.S., Wesley, R., Nichols, J., Kulkarni, A., Allen, J.F., Bigham, J.P., Chorus: A crowd-powered conversational assistant UIST; Won Lee, S., Zhang, Y., Wong, I., Yang, Y., O'Keefe, S.D., Lasecki, W.S., Sketchexpress: Remixing animations for more effective crowd-powered prototyping of interactive interfaces UIST; Micallef, L., Sundin, I., Marttinen, P., Ammad-Ud Din, M., Peltola, T., Soare, M., Jacucci, G., Kaski, S., Interactive elicitation of knowledge on feature relevance improves predictions in small data sets IUI; Muggleton, S., Learning from positive data (1996) Worshop on ILP.; Pennington, J., Socher, R., Manning, C.D., Glove: Global vectors for word representation (2014) EMNLP; Richardson, M., Domingos, P., Markov logic networks (2006) Machine Learning.; Settles, B., Craven, M., An analysis of active learning strategies for sequence labeling tasks EMNLP; Sherkat, E., Nourashrafeddin, S., Milios, E.E., Minghim, R., Interactive document clustering revisited: A visual analytics approach IUI; Smith, A., Kumar, V., Boyd-Graber, J., Seppi, K., Findlater, L., Closing the loop: User-centered design and evaluation of a human-inthe- loop topic modeling system IUI; Snow, R., O'Connor, B., Jurafsky, D., Ng, A.Y., Cheap and fast-but is it good?: Evaluating non-expert annotations for natural language tasks EMNLP; Yang, F., Yang, Z., Cohen, W.W., Differentiable learning of logical rules for knowledge base reasoning (2017) NIPS",,,Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL),"57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations, ACL 2019",28 July 2019 through 2 August 2019,,159207,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084076231

The knowledge contained in the picture is extracted using YOLO, a neural network-based object detection technique, and represented as an answer set program. Natural language processing is performed on the question to transform it into an ASP query. Semantic relations are extracted in the process for deeper understanding and to answer more complex questions. The resulting knowledge-base—with additional commonsense knowledge imported—can be used to perform reasoning using an ASP system, allowing it to answer questions about the picture, just like a human. This framework achieves 93.7% accuracy on CLEVR dataset, which exceeds human baseline performance. What is significant is that AQuA translates a question into an ASP query without requiring any training. Our framework for Visual Question Answering is quite general and closely simulates the way humans operate. In contrast to existing purely machine learning-based methods, our framework provides an explanation for the answer it computes, while maintaining high accuracy. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Answer set programming; Commonsense reasoning; Natural language understanding; Visual question answering,Knowledge based systems; Learning algorithms; Logic programming; Natural language processing systems; Object detection; Semantics; Answer set programming; Base-line performance; Commonsense knowledge; Commonsense reasoning; NAtural language processing; Natural language questions; Natural language understanding; Question Answering; Visual languages,"Cao, Q., Liang, X., Li, B., Li, G., Lin, L., Visual question reasoning on general dependency tree (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 7249-7257; Davidson, D., (2001) Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation: Philosophical Essays, 2. , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Gao, H., Mao, J., Zhou, J., Huang, Z., Wang, L., Xu, W., Are you talking to a machine?

Text mining approaches that can automatically process and annotate scientific literature with ontology concepts are necessary to keep up with the rapid pace of scientific publishing. Here, we present deep learning models (Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)) combined with different input encoding formats for automated Named Entity Recognition (NER) of ontology concepts from text. The Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text (CRAFT) gold standard corpus was used to train and test our models. Precision, Recall, F-1, and Jaccard semantic similarity were used to evaluate the performance of the models. We found that GRU-based models outperform LSTM models across all evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, considering the top two probabilistic predictions of the model for each instance instead of the top one resulted in a substantial increase in accuracy. Inclusion of ontology semantics via subsumption reasoning yielded modest performance improvement. © 2020 Owner/Author.",automated annotation; deep learning; named entity recognition; ontologies,Big data;

Language is perhaps the most complex behaviour that humans exhibit, and, as such, is one of the most difficult problems for understanding human cognition. Linguistic theory can both inform and be informed by unified models of cognition. We discuss (1) how computational models of human cognition can provide insight into how humans produce and comprehend language and (2) how the problem of modelling language processing raises questions and creates challenges for widely used computational models of cognition. Evidence from the literature suggests that behavioural phenomena, such as recency and priming effects, and cognitive constraints, such as working memory limits, affect how language is produced by humans in ways that can be predicted by computational cognitive models. But just as computational models can provide new insights into language, language can serve as a test for these models. For example, simulating language learning requires the use of more powerful machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and vector symbolic architectures, and language comprehension requires a capacity for on-the-fly situational model construction. In sum, language plays an important role in both shaping the development of a common model of the mind, and, in turn, the theoretical understanding of language stands to benefit greatly from the development of a common model. © 2018 The Authors.

A key challenge is to model cyber physical systems at the appropriate level of abstraction while maintaining a clear and understandable linkage between the human designer and the system under design. Fuzzy logic is a framework to synthesize linguistic, natural language requirements into machine learning models. It has been shown that fuzzy logic is a suitable method to learn the behavior of a nonlinear system when a model is not present. The implementation of a constrained fuzzy inference system presented in this paper is a specific class of machine learning architecture that provides a mechanism to relate a system model to human specified requirements. It is not at all dissimilar to more popular neural network architectures. The goal of this paper is to introduce a framework for constrained learning that enables both fast approximation of real valued systems while simultaneously enabling the modeling and analysis of safety properties. This paper focuses on a foundational constrained intelligent learning framework. The framework describes an alternative and constrained machine learning architecture capable of producing highly efficient structures that are also amenable to verification. This paper will focus on the efficiency of the computational structure while future papers will demonstrate the verifiability. © 2020 IEEE.",,Automata theory; Computational efficiency; Computer circuits; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Computational structure; Fast approximation; Fuzzy inference systems; Intelligent learning; Level of abstraction; Machine learning models; Natural language requirements; Verification-and-validation; Fuzzy logic,"Clark, M., Koutsoukos, X., Porter, J., Kumar, R., Pappas, G., Sokolsky, O., Lee, I., Pike, L., A study on run time assurance for complex cyber physical systems (2013) Technical Report, Air Force Research Lab, Wright-Patterson AFB, Aerospace Systems Directorate, , ohio; Alur, R., Courcoubetis, C., Henzinger, T.A., Ho, P., Hybrid automata: An algorithmic approach to the specification and verification of hybrid systems (1992) Hybrid Systems, pp. 209-229. , Springer; Firmin Snyder, C., (2013) Provable Run Time Safety Assurance for A Non-linear System.; Ivanov, R., Weimer, J., Alur, R., Pappas, G.J., Lee, I., Verisig: Verifying safety properties of hybrid systems with neural network controllers (2019) Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control, pp. 169-178; Brehm, T., Rattan, K.S., The classical controller: A special case of the fuzzy logic control (1994) Proceedings of the 33rd IEEE Decision and Control Conference, pp. 4128-4129; Brown, M., Harris, C., Neurofuzzy adaptive modelling and control (1995) Prentice Hall International (UK) Ltd.; Clark, M., Rattan, K., Ernest, N., Arnett, T., Cohen, K., Verification and validation of a genetic fuzzy tree for ucav control (2017) 2nd Edition Intelligent System Book, AIAA; Mamdani, E.H., Application of fuzzy algorithms for control of simple dynamic plant (1974) Proc.

Nonetheless, practicing analogical reasoning needs a knowledge-base. The paper proposes a framework for constructing a knowledge-base of urban constructs that builds on an ontology of urbanism. The framework is composed of two modules that are responsible for representing either the concepts or the features of any urban constructs' materialization. The concepts are represented as a knowledge graph (KG) named SpatialNet, while the physical features are represented by a deep neural network (DNN) called SpatialFeaturesNet. For structuring SpatialNet, as a KG that comprehensively conceptualizes spatial qualities, deep learning applied to natural language processing (NLP) is employed. The comprehensive concepts of SpatialNet are firstly discovered using semantic analyses of nine English lingual corpora and then structured using the urban ontology. The goal of the framework is to map the spatial features to the plethora of their matching concepts. The granularity ànd the coherence of the proposed framework is expected to sustain or substitute other known analogical, knowledge-based, inspirational design approaches such as case-based reasoning (CBR) and its analogical application on architectural design (CBD). © 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.",Case-based reasoning (cbr) and case-based design (cbd); Deep neural network for structuring kg; Domain-specific knowledge graph of urban qualities; Natural language processing and comprehensive understanding of urban constructs; Urban cognition and design creativity,Case based reasoning; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge representation; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Regional planning; Semantics; Analogical reasoning; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Design approaches; Design creativities; NAtural language processing; Physical features; Semantic analysis; Spatial features; Architectural design,"Ayzenshtadt, V., Espinoza-Stapelfeld, C., Langenhan, C., Althoff, K.-D., Multi-Agent-Based Generation of Explanations for Retrieval Results Within a Case-Based Support Framework for Architectural Design (2018) ICAART; Boden, M.

While deep learning models have achieved great success in multimodal tasks like visual question answering, recent studies have shown that they fail to generalize to new inputs that are simply an unseen combination of those seen in the training distribution [6]. In this paper, we propose to tackle this challenge by employing neural factor graphs to induce a tighter coupling between concepts in different modalities (e.g. images and text). Graph representations are inherently compositional in nature and allow us to capture entities, attributes and relations in a scalable manner. Our model first creates a multimodal graph, processes it with a graph neural network to induce a factor correspondence matrix, and then outputs a symbolic program to predict answers to questions. Empirically, our model achieves close to perfect scores on a caption truth prediction problem and state-of-the-art results on the recently introduced CLOSURE dataset, improving on the mean overall accuracy across seven compositional templates by 4.77% over previous approaches. © 2020 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Various attempts have been proposed for IE via feature engineering or deep learning. However, most of them fail to associate the complex relationships inherent in the task itself, which has proven to be especially crucial. For example, the relation between 2 entities is highly dependent on their entity types. These dependencies can be regarded as complex constraints that can be efficiently expressed as logical rules. To combine such logic reasoning capabilities with learning capabilities of deep neural networks, we propose to integrate logical knowledge in the form of first-order logic into a deep learning system, which can be trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. The integrated framework is able to enhance neural outputs with knowledge regularization via logic rules, and at the same time update the weights of logic rules to comply with the characteristics of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed model on multiple IE tasks. Copyright © 2020 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

Analogous to natural language, music can be modeled as a sequence of tokens. This motivates the majority of existing solutions to explore the utilization of word embedding models to build music embeddings. However, music differs from natural languages in two key aspects: (1) musical token is multi-faceted-it comprises of pitch, rhythm and dynamics information; and (2) musical context is two-dimensional-each musical token is dependent on both melodic and harmonic contexts. In this work, we provide a comprehensive solution by proposing a novel framework named PiRhDy that integrates pitch, rhythm, and dynamics information seamlessly. PiRhDy adopts a hierarchical strategy which can be decomposed into two steps: (1) token (i.e., note event) modeling, which separately represents pitch, rhythm, and dynamics and integrates them into a single token embedding; and (2) context modeling, which utilizes melodic and harmonic knowledge to train the token embedding. A thorough study was made on each component and sub-strategy of PiRhDy.We further validate our embeddings in three downstream tasks-melody completion, accompaniment suggestion, and genre classification. Results indicate a significant advancement of the neural approach towards symbolic music as well as PiRhDy's potential as a pretrained tool for a broad range of symbolic music applications. © 2020 ACM.",embeddings; representation learning; symbolic music,Deep learning; Dynamics; Context modeling; Genre classification; Hierarchical strategies; Music applications; Natural languages; Embeddings,"Alvarez, A.A., Gómez-Martin, F., Distributed vector representations of folksong motifs (2019) Proceedings of the International Conference on Mathematics and Computation in Music, pp. 325-332. , Springer; Böck, S., Schedl, M., Polyphonic piano note transcription with recurrent neural networks (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 Ieee International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, pp. 121-124. , IEEE; Brown, T.B., Mann, B., Ryder, N., Subbiah, M., Kaplan, J., Dhariwal, P., Neelakantan, A., Amodei, D., (2020) Language Models Are Few-Shot Learners, , 2020; Chuan, C.-H., Agres, K., Herremans, D., From context to concept: Exploring semantic relationships in music with word 2vec (2020) Neural Computing and Applications, 32 (4), pp. 1023-1036. , 2020); Chuan, C.-H., Herremans, D., Modeling temporal tonal relations in polyphonic music through deep networks with a novel image-based representation (2018) Proceedings of the 32nd Aaai Conference on Artifcial Intelligence., pp. 2159-2166; Damak, K., Nasraoui, O., (2019) SeER: An Explainable Deep Learning MIDI-based Hybrid Song Recommender System, , arXiv preprint, (2019); Devlin, J., Chang, M.-W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., (2018) BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, , arXiv preprint, (2018); Dong, H.-W., Hsiao, W.-Y., Yang, L.-C., Yang, Y.-H., Musegan: Multi-track sequential generative adversarial networks for symbolic music generation and accompaniment (2018) Proceedings of the 32nd Aaai Conference on Artifcial Intelligence., pp. 34-41; Dong, H.-W., Hsiao, W.-Y., Yang, Y.-H., Pypianoroll: Open source python package for handling multitrack pianoroll (2018) Late-Breaking Demos of the 18th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference; Ferraro, A., Lemström, K., On large-scale genre classifcation in symbolically encoded music by automatic identifcation of repeating patterns (2018) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Digital Libraries for Musicology., pp. 34-37; Herremans, D., Chuan, C.-H., Modeling musical context with word2vec (2017) Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Deep Learning and Music., pp. 11-18; Hirai, T., Sawada, S., Melody2vec: Distributed representations of melodic phrases based on melody segmentation (2019) Journal of Information Processing, 27, pp. 278-286. , 2019; Anna Huang, C.-Z., Duvenaud, D., Gajos, K.Z., Chor-dripple: Recommending chords to help novice composers go beyond the ordinary (2016) Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces., pp. 241-250; Jackendof, R., Parallels and nonparallels between language and music.

However, the inductive bias of these models (formed by the distributional hypothesis of language), while ideally suited to modeling most running text, results in key limitations for today's models. In particular, the models often struggle to learn certain spatial, temporal, or quantitative relationships, which are commonplace in text and are second-nature for human readers. Yet, in many cases, these relationships can be encoded with simple mathematical or logical expressions. How can we augment today's neural models with such encodings In this paper, we propose a general methodology to enhance the inductive bias of NNLMs by incorporating simple functions into a neural architecture to form a hierarchical neural-symbolic language model (NSLM). These functions explicitly encode symbolic deterministic relationships to form probability distributions over words. We explore the effectiveness of this approach on numbers and geographic locations, and show that NSLMs significantly reduce perplexity in small-corpus language modeling, and that the performance improvement persists for rare tokens even on much larger corpora. The approach is simple and general, and we discuss how it can be applied to other word classes beyond numbers and geography. © 2020 The Twenty-Fifth AAAI/SIGAI Doctoral Consortium (AAAI-20).

Users spend a considerable amount of time scrolling through social media feeds to find something relatable, either emotionally or as a problem in their daily life that they want to solve. By analyzing the content produced by social media users, we can know if his opinion is relatively optimistic, neutral, or pessimistic about the subject – that varies from a service, news, a movie, etc. There are multiple approaches for sentiment analysis; first, there’s the Machine learning with its numerous methods that can be either supervised or unsupervised. Second, the Lexicon-based approach. Third, the combination of the two approaches – which is called a hybrid. Also, there are other approaches that we can add to get a more optimized result, such as working on improving text preprocessing techniques or by adding Fuzzy Logic approach and subjectivity detection. In this paper, we continued the same path as in our previous work [1]. We used the same ontologies, the same data collected about Brexit and also the same text preprocessing method. We applied a subjectivity detection using Long Short-Term Memory so that our model can predict subjectivity in a text. We did that by applying a fuzzy logic method based on the Lexicon based polarity and subjectivity classifier to classify the text into one of 5 categories. Finally, we come up with a comparison that summarizes every approach with their result. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Classification; Decision Tree; Fuzzy Logic; Machine learning; Naïve Bayes; Sentiment analysis; Support Vector Machine,,"Ihab, M., Soumaya, L., Mohamed, B., Haytam, H., Abdelhadi, F., Ontology-based sentiment analysis and community detection on social media: Application to Brexit (2019) SCA 2019: Proceedings of the 4Th International Conference on Smart City Applications, pp. 1-7. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3368756.3369090, , pp; Gaikwad, A.S., Mokhade, A.S., Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning and Ontology.

The ability to handle and preserve uncertainty in natural language is an essential skill for clinicians, facilitating decidability and effective clinical reasoning processes despite incomplete knowledge in some situations. This has been addressed by previous research in clinical NLP by the development of algorithms that detect uncertainty expressions. However, existing rule-based algorithms have limited uncertainty detection capabilities. Therefore, we seek to reformulate uncertainty detection as a supervised machine learning problem by (i) reevaluating the concept of uncertainty, (ii) embedding this understanding in an improved linguistic uncertainty taxonomy and (iii) introducing a new dataset of EHRs annotated for nine types of uncertainty – the first publicly available dataset of its kind. Many of our classes are novel and emphasise implicit uncertainties – a form of uncertainty that is ignored by existing algorithms, yet has crucial functions in clinical settings. Through an evaluation of our dataset, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach and its utility in relation to research on clinical information extraction. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Information extraction; Linguistic uncertainty; NLP,Clinical research; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Supervised learning; Taxonomies; Clinical reasoning; Detection capability; Incomplete knowledge; Information extraction; Linguistic uncertainty; Natural languages; Reasoning process; Rule based algorithms; Supervised machine learning; Uncertainty; Natural language processing systems,"Chapman, W.W., Bridewell, W., Hanbury, P., Cooper, G.F., Buchanan, B.G., A simple algorithm for identifying negated findings and diseases in discharge summaries (2001) J.

But, its inner architecture acts as a black box, because the users cannot understand why such decisions are made. Bayesian reasoning (BR) provides explanation facility and causal reasoning in terms of uncertainty which is able to overcome demerit of DL. This paper is to propose a framework for the integration of DL and BR by leveraging their complementary merits based on their inherent internal architecture. The migration from deep neural network (DNN) to Bayesian network (BN) involves extracting rules from DNN and constructing an efficient BN based on the rules generated, to provide intelligent decision support with accurate recommendations and logical explanations to the users. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Bayesian reasoning; Black box of deep learning; Integration; Rule extraction,Bayesian networks; Big data; Character recognition; Decision support systems; Integration; Network architecture; Bayesian reasoning; Black boxes; Causal reasoning; Extracting rules; Intelligent decision support; Internal architecture; Rule extraction; Text recognition; Deep neural networks,"Kim, B., (2015) Interactive and Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Human Machine Collaboration.

They are useful for understanding the shortcomings of machine learning models, interpreting their results, and for regularisation. In NLP, however, most example generation strategies produce input text by using known, pre-specified semantic transformations, requiring significant manual effort and in-depth understanding of the problem and domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of automatically generating adversarial examples that violate a set of given First-Order Logic constraints in Natural Language Inference (NLI). We reduce the problem of identifying such adversarial examples to a combinatorial optimisation problem, by maximising a quantity measuring the degree of violation of such constraints and by using a language model for generating linguistically-plausible examples. Furthermore, we propose a method for adversarially regularising neural NLI models for incorporating background knowledge. Our results show that, while the proposed method does not always improve results on the SNLI and MultiNLI datasets, it significantly and consistently increases the predictive accuracy on adversarially-crafted datasets – up to a 79.6% relative improvement – while drastically reducing the number of background knowledge violations. Furthermore, we show that adversarial examples transfer among model architectures, and that the proposed adversarial training procedure improves the robustness of NLI models to adversarial examples. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,Combinatorial optimization; Formal logic; Semantics; Back-ground knowledge; In-depth understanding; Machine learning models; Model architecture; Natural languages; Predictive accuracy; Semantic transformation; Training procedures; Machine learning,"Belinkov, Y., Bisk, Y., Synthetic and natural noise both break neural machine translation (2017) CoRR; Bengio, Y., Ducharme, R., Vincent, P., A neural probabilistic language model (2000) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 13, Papers from Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2000, pp. 932-938. , MIT Press; van Benthem, J., A brief history of natural logic (2008) Logic, Navya-Nyaya and Applications: Homage to Bimal Matilal, , M.

Advances in sensor technology, the Internet, social networks, wireless communication, and inexpensive memory have all contributed to an explosion of ""Big Data"". Big data is created in many ways in today's highly inter-connected world. Social networks, system of systems (SoS: complex interoperable) systems and wireless systems are only some of the platforms creating big data. Recent efforts have developed a promising approach, called ""Data Analytics"", which uses statistical and computational intelligence (CI) tools such as principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary computation, Bayesian networks, etc. to reduce the size of ""Big Data"" to a manageable size and apply these tools to a) extract information, b) build a knowledge base using the derived data, and c) eventually develop a non-parametric model for the ""Big Data"". This paper attempts to construct a bridge between SoS and Data Analytic to develop reliable models for such systems. One of the recent most promising data analytic too is ""Deep Learning"". Deep learning is the broad term for the recent development and extensions of neural networks in the machine learning community, which has allowed for state of the art results in speech, image, and natural language processing tasks. Hierarchical learning is an area of research which focuses on learning high order representations from low level data. Learning to recognize objects from images, recognizing words or syllables from audio, or recognizing poses and movement from video are all good examples of modern hierarchical learning research, which is a central focus of the ''deep learning"" movement in the machine learning and computational statistics community. This paper will give a rather comprehensive look at all the BIG data analytic tools - old and new.

Thus, to be efficient, automatic information extraction systems have to exploit semantic resources (or ontologies) and employ machine-learning techniques to make them more adaptive. This paper presents an Ontology-based Information Extraction method using Inductive Logic Programming that allows inducing symbolic predicates expressed in Horn clausal logic that subsume information extraction rules. Such rules allow the system to extract class and relation instances from English corpora for ontology population purposes. Several experiments were conducted and preliminary experimental results are promising, showing that the proposed approach improves previous work over extracting instances of classes and relations, either separately or altogether. © 2013 IEEE.",Inductive Logic Programming; Ontology Population; Ontology-based Information Extraction,Automatic information extraction; Information extraction rules; Machine learning techniques; Ontology Population; Ontology-based information extraction; Ontology-based methods; Semantic resources; Time-consuming tasks; Artificial intelligence; Inductive logic programming (ILP); Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Semantics; Tools; Ontology,"Baeza-Yates, R.A., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (1999) Modern Information Retrieval, , Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing, Boston, USA; Cimiano, P., (2006) Ontology Learning and Population from Text: Algorithms, , Evaluation and Applications, Springer Verlag, New York, USA; Raedt, L.D., Inductive logic programming (2010) Encyclopedia of Machine Learning, pp. 529-537; Finn, A., A multi-level boundary classification approach to information extraction (2006) Phd Thesis, , University College Dublin; Giuliano, C., Lavelli, A., Romano, L., Relation extraction and the influence of automatic ner (2007) ACM Transactions on Speech and Language Processing, 5 (1). , ACM; Kruijff, G.-J.M., Formal and computational aspects of dependency grammar: History and development of dg (2002) Tech.

They provide succinct instructions such as what drugs should be given or taken for a particular condition, how long such treatment should be given, what tests should be conducted, or other situational clinical circumstances for certain diseases. However, as they are described in natural language, they are prone to problems such as variability and ambiguity. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically infer the main components in clinical guideline sentences. Knowing the key concepts in the sentences, we can then feed them to model checkers to validate their correctness. We adapt semantic role labelling approach to mark the key entities in our problem domain. We also implement the technique used for Named-Entity Recognition (NER) task and compare the results. The aim of our work is to build a reasoning framework that combines the information gained from real patient data and clinical practice, with clinical guidelines to give more suitable personalised recommendations for treating patients. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Formal verification; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Text tagging; Therapy algorithms,Hospital data processing; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Clinical guideline; Clinical practices; Named entity recognition; Natural languages; Particular condition; Personalised recommendations; Reasoning framework; Semantic annotations; Model checking,"Bäumler, S., Balser, M., Dunets, A., Reif, W., Schmitt, J.: Verification of medical guidelines by model checking – a case study.

Some recent efforts, such as the skip-gram model, have attempted to learn word representations that can capture both syntactic and semantic information among text corpus. However, they still lack the capability of encoding the properties of words and the complex relationships among words very well, since text itself often contains incomplete and ambiguous information. Fortunately, knowledge graphs provide a golden mine for enhancing the quality of learned word representations. In particular, a knowledge graph, usually composed by entities (words, phrases, etc.), relations between entities, and some corresponding meta information, can supply invaluable relational knowledge that encodes the relationship between entities as well as categorical knowledge that encodes the attributes or properties of entities. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework called RC-NET to leverage both the relational and categorical knowledge to produce word representations of higher quality. Specifically, we build the relational knowledge and the categorical knowledge into two separate reg-ularization functions, and combine both of them with the original objective function of the skip-gram model. By solving this combined optimization problem using back propagation neural networks, we can obtain word representations enhanced by the knowledge graph. Experiments on popular text mining and natural language processing tasks, including analogical reasoning, word similarity, and topic prediction, have all demonstrated that our model can significantly improve the quality of word representations.

However, some application domains, like security or medicine, may need an explanation of this annotation. Explainable Artificial Intelligence is an answer to this need. In this work, an explanation is a sentence in natural language that is dedicated to human users to provide them clues about the process that leads to the decision: the labels assignment to image parts. We focus on semantic image annotation with fuzzy logic that has proven to be a useful framework that captures both image segmentation imprecision and the vagueness of human spatial knowledge and vocabulary. In this paper, we present an algorithm for textual explanation generation of the semantic annotation of image regions. © 2021 IEEE.",Explanation; fuzzy constraint satisfaction problems; natural language generation; semantic annotation,Deep learning; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Image analysis; Image annotation; Semantics; Human users; Image regions; Natural languages; Semantic annotations; Semantic image annotations; Spatial knowledge; Image segmentation,"McKinney, S.M., Sieniek, M., Godbole, V., Godwin, J., Antropova, N., Ashrafian, H., Back, T., Shetty, S., International evaluation of an ai system for breast cancer screening (2020) Nature, 577 (7788), pp. 89-94. , 1; Doshi-Velez, F., Kim, B., (2017) Towards A Rigorous Science of Interpretable Machine Learning, , eprint; Miller, T., Explanation in artificial intelligence: Insights from the social sciences (2019) Artificial Intelligence, 2679, pp. 1-38; Waltz, D., Understanding line drawings of scenes with shadows (1975) The Psychology of Computer Vision, , McGraw-Hill; Deruyver, A., Hodé, Y., Brun, L., Image interpretation with a conceptual graph: Labeling over-segmented images and detection of unexpected objects (2009) Artificial Intelligence, 173 (14), pp. 1245-1265; Vanegas Orozco, M.C., Spatial relations and spatial reasoning for the interpretation of earth observation images using a structural model (2011) Theses, Télécom ParisTech, , Jan; Pierrard, R., Poli, J.-P., Hudelot, C., Spatial relation learning for explainable image classification and annotation in critical applications (2021) Artificial Intelligence, 292, p. 103434; Bloch, I., (2013) Fuzzy Models of Spatial Relations, Application to Spatial Reasoning, pp. 51-58. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Li, Y., Li, S., A fuzzy sets theoretic approach to approximate spatial reasoning (2004) IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 12 (6), pp. 745-754. , Dec; Schockaert, S., Cock, M.D., Cornelis, C., Kerre, E.E., Fuzzy region connection calculus: Representing vague topological information (2008) International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 48 (1), pp. 314-331. , special Section: Perception Based Data Mining and Decision Support Systems; Cayrol, M., Farreny, H., Prade, H., Fuzzy pattern matching (1982) Kybernetes, 11 (2), pp. 103-116; Colliot, O., (2003) Représentation, évaluation et Utilisation de Relations Spatiales pour L'interprétation D'images.

The idea here is to use Memory Based Language Processing (MBLP) algorithm for Malayalam morphological analysis. MBLP is an approach to language processing based on exemplar storage during learning, and analogical reasoning during processing. The aim of the system is to find the citation forms (or meaningful parts) of words rather than a detailed morphological analysis. Training instances created from words are manually annotated for their segmentation and the system is trained using TiMBL (Tilburg Memory based Learner).

It deals with high-dimensional and raw data. Through layer-by-layer stacking transformation, deep neural networks are trained, new rules being learnt. Therefore, even if the new data is given, the networks can automatically transform the data to an accurate knowledge representation based the new rules. The text classification process of deep learning, however, is subject to requirements from specific environments. If the premises cannot be satisfied, the robustness and accuracy of classification will be greatly weakened. Meanwhile, deep learning corresponds to a process of black-box training, and it is impossible to describe feature information artificially or explain the training results in many scenarios. If deep learning is to have a highly intelligent learning ability akin to that of human beings, it is necessary to add to it a high-level reasoning and judgment process similar to the human cognitive process. Motivated by causal regularity, we proposed a conjoint reasoning framework, named Causal Regularity Inference Framework (CRIF), which is based on the combination of causal regularity and deep learning to achieve text classification. Causal inference meets the requirements of high-level information reasoning. It can determine the correlations and causalities between the inputs and find out confounding feature words at the same time. Causal inference makes the training of deep learning more reasonable and explicable. Therefore, effective feature extraction can be carried out in the text processing to remove invalid confounding words, and reduce the data redundancy in training process and improve the accuracy of the text classification. © 2021 IEEE.",causal-regularity; deep learning; inference,Classification (of information); Deep neural networks; Knowledge representation; Multilayer neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; Causal inferences; Causal-regularity; Deep learning; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Inference; Input datas; Layer by layer; Metadata information; Test data; Text processing,"Li, Y., Chen, Y.H., Liu, T., Survey on predicting information propagation in microblog (2016) Ruan Jian Xue Bao/Journal of Software, 27 (2), pp. 247-263. , in Chinese; Church, K., Word 2vec (2017) Natural Language Engineering, 23 (1), pp. 155-162; Dan, T.P., Xu, T.C., Zhang, S.H., A chinese text classification system based on improved tf-idf feature[J] (2020) Computer & Digital Engineering, 48 (3), pp. 556-560; Huang, X., Liu, G., Liu, X., Sentiment classification depth model based on word 2vec and bi-directional lstm[J] (2019) Application Research of Computers; Pearl, J., (2008) Causal Inference As Computational Learning; Wang, L., Michoel, T., Efficient causal inference with hidden confounders from genome-transcriptome variation data[J] (2016) PLoS Computational Biology, 13 (8), p. e1005703; Gan, K., Li, A.A., Lipton, Z.C., (2020) Causal Inference with Selectively-Deconfounded Data[J]; Huang, W., Liu, H., Bowman, S.R., Counterfactually-Augmented snli training data does not yield better generalization than unaugmented data[C] (2020) Proceedings of the First Workshop on Insights from Negative Results in Nlp; Zeng, S., Bayir, M.A., Pfeiffer, J., (2020) Causal Transfer Random Forest: Combining Logged Data and Randomized Experiments for Robust Prediction[J]; Li, Q., Peng, H., Li, J., (2020) A Survey on Text Classification: From Shallow to Deep Learning[J]; Neterer, J.R., Guzide, O., (2018) Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing; Zhu, X., Sobhani, P., Guo, H., (2015) Long Short-Term Memory over Tree Structures[J], , arXiv; Rubin, W., Rubin, D.B., Causal inference using potential outcomes: Design, modeling, decisions,\""\ (2005) Journal of the American Statistical Association,\, 100, pp. 322-331. , Comment by Wong and Reply[J].

Any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal may be defined as AI. The family of AI research is rich and varied. For example, cognitive computing is a comprehensive set of capabilities based on technologies such as deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing, reasoning and decision technologies, speech and vision technologies, human interface technologies, semantic technology, dialog and narrative generation, among other technologies. Artificial intelligence and robotics have steadily growing roles in our lives and have the potential to transform vital functions of the society. Organizations benefit from the ability of cognitive systems to improve their expertise quickly and from sharing it to all those who need it. The know-how of top experts is quickly made available to all, when their subject matter expertise is taught to a cognitive system. Through repeated use, the system will provide increasingly accurate responses, eventually eclipsing the accuracy of human experts. With artificial intelligence, comprehension can be outsourced. As the intelligence of machines improve, they will use deep learning to understand the collective information of humankind. With the use of digital sensor data, equipment based on artificial intelligence can used to develop smart advisors, teachers or assistants. As artificial intelligence technology is helping society to advance, there are risks associated with its use, found in the operating systems, hardware, algorithms, system management, ethics and liability, and privacy. The study focuses on artificial intelligence threats and risks and how AI may help to solve cyber security problems. This study uses taxonomy classification principle to classify 12 the most crucial areas of cyber security. Research method of this study was to gather 11 AI solutions that were divided into seven different categories of the crucial areas of cyber security represented in introduction chapter. AI solutions gathered uses artificial intelligence in detecting and predicting information security threats and anomalies and blocking them. The purpose of this study is to classify AI-based cyber security solutions gathered, and provide information what they can offer in solving problems in the field of cyber security. © 2019 14th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2019.

Deep learning achieves good data representation according to a data distribution and get over state of the art classifiers in computer vision and speech recognition. The representation captures abstracts of many data and is used as general features to solve many types of classification problems. A neural network is applied to natural language processing, too. In natural language processing neural networks achieve the best distributed representation of words and many researchers pay attention to the neural network language model. The distributed representation allocates words in a continuous feature space and there are semantically or syntactically similar words near area in the space. Hence, the distributed representation contributes to a solution of analogical reasoning tasks. In this paper a sparse neural network language model (SNNLM) is used, which achieves sparse active neurons in the hidden layer and a distributed representation of words is obtained. In evaluational experiments SNNLM selects words that do not occur in the same sentence at all as related words and it is confirmed that the word selection is appropriate manually. © 2014 IEEE.",Natural language processing; Neural network,Abstract data types; Computational linguistics; Computer vision; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Analogical reasoning; Continuous features; Data distribution; Distributed representation; NAtural language processing; Network language; Sparse neural networks; State of the art; Speech recognition,"Deerwester, S., Dumais, S., Furnas, G.W., Landauer, T.K., Harshman, R., (1990) Indexing by Latent Semantic Analysis Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 41 (6), pp. 391-407; Murphy, K.P., (2012) Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, , MIT Press; Yanagimoto, H., Sparse neural network language model (2014) Proc, of the 7th IADIS International Conference on Information Systems 2014; Krizhevsky, A., Salakhutdinov, R.R., Hinton, G.E., ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing, 25. , MIT Pres; Hinton, G.E., Salakhutdinov, R.R., Reducing the dimensionality of data with neural networks (2006) Science, 313, pp. 504-507; Bengio, Y., Learning deep architecture of ai (2009) Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning, 2 (1); Hinton, G.E., Osindero, S., Teh, Y., A fast learning algorithm for deep blief nets (2006) Neural Computation, 18, pp. 1527-1554; Lee, H., Battle, A., Raina, R., Ng, Y.A., Efficient sparse coding algorithm (2006) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 19, pp. 801-808; Bengio, Y., Fucharme, R., Vincent, P., A neural probabilistic language model (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 1137-1155; Schwenk, H., Continuous space language models (2007) Computer Speech and Language, 21, pp. 492-518; Mikolov, T., Chen, K., Corrado, G., Dean, J., (2013) Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space, , arXiv: 130. 3781; Mikolov, T., Yih, W., Zweig, G., Linguistic regularities in continuous space word representation (2013) Proc, of the 2013 Conference of North America Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G., Dean, J., (2013) Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and Their Compositionality, , arXiv: 1310. 4546; Zou, W.Y., Socher, R., Cer, D., Manning, C.D., Bilingual word embeddings for phrase-based machine translation (2013) Proc, of Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2013, pp. 1170-1179; Kim, J., De Marneffe, M., Deriving adjectival scales from continuous space word representation (2013) Proc, of Conference on Empirical Methods in Neural Language Processing (EMNLP 2013, pp. 1625-1630; Kudo, T., Yamamoto, K., Matsumoto, Y., Applying conditional random fields to japanese morphological analysis (2004) Proc, of the 2004 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 230-237","Yanagimoto, H.; School of Engineering, Osaka Prefecture UniversityJapan",International Institute of Applied Informatics,IEEE,"3rd IIAI International Conference on Advanced Applied Informatics, IIAI-AAI 2014",31 August 2014 through 4 September 2014,,109434,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84918580291

Though mechanisms to develop similarity models for these areas do exist, in practice they have been criticised within various domains by experts who feel that the output is not indicative of their viewpoint. In field service provision for telecommunication organisations, it can be particularly challenging to understand task similarity from the perspective of an expert engineer. With that in mind, this paper demonstrates a similarity model developed from text recorded by engineer’s themselves to develop a metric directly indicative of expert opinion. We evaluate several methods of learning text representations on a classification task developed from engineers’ notes. Furthermore, we introduce a means to make use of the complex and multi-faceted aspect of the notes to recommend additional information to support engineers in the field. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",Case-based reasoning; Deep metric learning; Information retrieval; Machine learning; Metric learning; Similarity modeling,Case based reasoning; Engineers; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Text processing; Classification tasks; Expert opinion; In-field; Learning text; Metric learning; Risk information; Similarity models; Specific works; Deep learning,"Ackerman, M.S., Pipek, V., Wulf, V., (2003) Sharing Expertise: Beyond Knowledge Management, , MIT press, Cambridge; Bromley, J., Guyon, I., Lecun, Y., Signature verification using a ‘siamese’ time delay neural network (1993) Int.

The applicative context is the design of an operational assistant. The specific learning task that is focused on is the transfer from requests in natural language to commands in programming language. This work explores two questions for applying analogy in incremental learning situations: How does formal analogical reasoning behave in incremental learning situation? How do the conditions on the learning sequence influence the performance? To address these issues, an experimental setup is proposed in which multiple users are simulated. The knowledge transfer from one to the other is studied. Moreover, we discuss the influence of the order in which examples are presented to the system on the learning process. © 2016 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Knowledge management; Analogical reasoning; Incremental learning; Knowledge transfer; Learning process; Learning sequences; Multiple user; Natural languages; Specific learning; Learning systems,"Lepage, Y., Solving analogies on words: An algorithm (1998) Proceedings of the 36th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, 1, pp. 728-734. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3115/980845.980967, ser.

Attractors-subsets of a state space to which a dynamical system returns when perturbed-are a broadly relevant dynamical systems phenomenon. The mathematical theory has mainly focused on autonomous dynamical systems (i.e., not driven by an environment) of the form f : X → X (where x(t+1) = f(x(t)) [iterated map] or dx/dt = f(x) [differential equation]), and discovered a rich inventory of attractors, including stable fixed points, limit cycles, and chaos. Here, I focus on the iterated map case and consider certain nonautonomous dynamical systems characterized by a finite set of functions f1; f2; :::; fk : X → X and a language on alphabet σ = {1; : : : ; k} of one-sided infinite strings which applies the functions in particular orders starting from a specified initial state x(0) in X. I extend the definition of attractor by considering cases where the system returns to an invariant proper subset when perturbed in the environment of the language.

This information can be arranged in machine-readable formats, useful for several applications that need structured semantic knowledge. The work presented in this paper explores different strategies to automate the extraction of semantic relations from texts in Portuguese, Galician and Spanish. Both machine learning (distant-supervised and supervised) and rule-based techniques are investigated, and the impact of the different levels of linguistic knowledge is analyzed for the various approaches. Regarding domains, the experiments are focused on the extraction of encyclopedic knowledge, by means of the development of biographical relations classifiers (in a closed domain) and the evaluation of an open information extraction tool. To implement the extraction systems, several natural language processing tools have been built for the three research languages: From sentence splitting and tokenization modules to part-of-speech taggers, named entity recognizers and coreference resolution systems. Furthermore, several lexica and corpora have been compiled and enriched with different levels of linguistic annotation, which are useful for both training and testing probabilistic and symbolic models. As a result of the performed work, new resources and tools are available for automated processing of texts in Portuguese, Galician and Spanish. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Coreference resolution; Information extraction; Named entity recognition; Natural language processing; Part-of-speech tagging,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Data mining; Information analysis; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linguistics; Semantics; Speech recognition; Co-reference resolutions; Information extraction tools; Machine-readable format; Named entity recognition; NAtural language processing; Natural Language Processing Tools; Part of speech tagging; Semantic relation extractions; Natural language processing systems,"Agichtein, E., Gravano, L., Snowball: Extracting relations from large plain-text collections (2000) Proceedings of the 5Th ACM International Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 85-94; Banko, M., Cafarella, M., Soderland, S., Broadhead, M., Etzioni, O., Open information extraction from the web (2007) Proceedings of the 20Th International Joint Conference on Artifical Intelligence (IJCAI 2007), pp. 2670-2676; Barcala, F.M., Noya, D.E.M., Otero, P.G., Martínez, L.M., Mato, M.E.M., Rojo, G., del Río, S.M.P., Docío, S.S., A corpus and lexical resources for multi-word terminology extraction in the field of economy in a in a minority language (2007) Human Language Technologies as a Challenge for Computer Science and Linguistics, Proceedings of the 3rd Language & Technology Conference, pp. 359-363; Branco, A., Silva, J.R., Contractions: Breaking the tokenization-tagging circularity (2003) PROPOR 2003.

Currently, providing teachers with detailed feedback about the talk moves in their lessons requires highly trained observers to hand code transcripts of classroom recordings and analyze talk moves and/or one-on-one expert coaching, a time-consuming and expensive process that is unlikely to scale. We created a bidirectional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) network that can automate the annotation process. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this deep learning approach to reliably identify a set of teacher talk moves at the sentence level with an F1 measure of 65%. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

In this paper, we present a two-step method that combines information retrieval techniques optimized for question answering with deep learning models for natural language inference in order to tackle the multiple-choice question answering problem. In the first stage, each question-answer pair is fed into an information retrieval engine to find relevant candidate contexts that serve as the underlying knowledge for the inference models. In the second stage, deep learning architectures are used to predict if a candidate answer can be inferred from the context extracted in the first stage. We deploy multiple deep learning architectures pre-trained on different datasets in order to capture semantic features and to enlarge the scope of the questions we can answer correctly. As it will be described, each dataset used for training the inference models has particular characteristics that can be exploited. In the end, all these solvers are combined in an ensemble model to predict the correct answer. This proposed two-step model outperforms the best retrieval-based solver by over 3% in absolute accuracy. Moreover, the model can answer both simple, factoid questions and more complex questions that require reasoning or inference. © 2019 IEEE.",deep learning; information retrieval; natural language inference; neural networks; question answering,Complex networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Information retrieval; Network architecture; Neural networks; Search engines; Semantics; Complex questions; Ensemble modeling; Learning architectures; Multiple choice questions; NAtural language processing; Natural languages; Question Answering; Question-answer pairs; Natural language processing systems,"Zhang, Y., Dai, H., Toraman, K., Song, L., Kg2: Learning to reason science exam questions with contextual knowledge graph embeddings (2018) CoRR, , abs/1805.12393; Schoenick, C., Clark, P., Tafjord, O., Turney, P.D., Etzioni, O., Moving beyond the turing test with the allen ai science challenge (2017) Commun.

Several machine learning (ML) tools are currently being used for direct marketing. However, the disadvantage of ML algorithmic models is that even though results could be accurate, they lack relevant explanations. The lack of detailed explanations that justify recommendations has led to reduced trust in ML-based recommendations for decision making in some critical real-world domains. The telecommunication domain has continued to witness a decline of revenue in core areas such as voice and text messaging services which make direct marketing useful to increase profit. This paper presents the conceptual design of a machine learning process framework that will enable telecom subscribers that should be targeted for direct marketing of new products to be identified, and also provide explanations for the recommendations. To do this, a hybrid framework that employs supervised learning, case-based reasoning and rule-based reasoning is proposed. The operational workflow of the framework is demonstrated with an example, while the plan of implementation and evaluation are also discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Case-based reasoning; Direct marketing; Explainable AI; Machine learning; Telecommunication,Case based reasoning; Commerce; Conceptual design; Decision making; Machine learning; Product design; Telecommunication services; Text messaging; Turing machines; Algorithmic model; Direct marketing; Hybrid framework; Hybrid machine learning; Product offerings; Real world domain; Rule based reasoning; Telecom industry; Marketing,"Alanen, A., (2016) Efficient Direct Marketing: Case: Valtapinnoite Oy; Yu, C., Zhang, Z., Lin, C., Wu, Y.J., Can data-driven precision marketing promote user ad clicks?

However, a major challenge is that code is written using an open, rapidly changing vocabulary due to, e.g., the coinage of new variable and method names. Reasoning over such a vocabulary is not something for which most NLP methods are designed. We introduce a Graph-Structured Cache to address this problem; this cache contains a node for each new word the model encounters with edges connecting each word to its occurrences in the code. We find that combining this graph-structured cache strategy with recent Graph-Neural-Network-based models for supervised learning on code improves the models' performance on a code completion task and a variable naming task - with over 100% relative improvement on the latter - at the cost of a moderate increase in computation time. © 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2019.

"Wang H., Poon H.",56900754900;15056546800;,Deep probabilistic logic: A unifying framework for indirect supervision,2020,"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2018",,,,1891,1902,,10,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081722510&partnerID=40&md5=dd68378f6ec827f2ccb747e8328ec9db,"Deep learning has emerged as a versatile tool for a wide range of NLP tasks, due to its superior capacity in representation learning. But its applicability is limited by the reliance on annotated examples, which are difficult to produce at scale. Indirect supervision has emerged as a promising direction to address this bottleneck, either by introducing labeling functions to automatically generate noisy examples from unlabeled text, or by imposing constraints over interdependent label decisions. A plethora of methods have been proposed, each with respective strengths and limitations. Probabilistic logic offers a unifying language to represent indirect supervision, but end-to-end modeling with probabilistic logic is often infeasible due to intractable inference and learning. In this paper, we propose deep probabilistic logic (DPL) as a general framework for indirect supervision, by composing probabilistic logic with deep learning. DPL models label decisions as latent variables, represents prior knowledge on their relations using weighted first-order logical formulas, and alternates between learning a deep neural network for the end task and refining uncertain formula weights for indirect supervision, using variational EM. This framework subsumes prior indirect supervision methods as special cases, and enables novel combination via infusion of rich domain and linguistic knowledge. Experiments on biomedical machine reading demonstrate the promise of this approach. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics",,Computer circuits; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Modeling languages;

However, due to the interpretability of deep learning and the emergence of adversarial examples attacks, their reliability has been put into doubt. As for Natural Language Processing, adversarial samples that can be semantically similar to the original ones can also be generated so that NLP classification can be fooled without human observers' attention. In this paper, we give an overview of the existing method in implementing adversarial examples attacks. Firstly, we introduce the implementation of these methods and the damage they impose on the security, integrity, and robustness of NLP systems. Secondly, we discuss problems like the limited attention on the logic of defense, the curse of dimensionality, and the difficulty of implementing white-box adversaries. Finally, to present our opinion on ML security's structure, our discussion upon the standardization of both attack and defense is also included. © 2021 IEEE.",Adversarial Examples Attacks; Deep Learning; Natural Language Processing; Word Embedding,Deep learning; Information systems; Information use; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Current status; Curse of dimensionality; Human observers; Interpretability; Limited attentions; NAtural language processing; NLP systems; Real-world scenario; Data communication systems,"Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I., Fergus, R., (2014) Intriguing Properties of Neural Networks; Kurakin, A., Goodfellow, I.J., Bengio, S., Adversarial examples in the physical world (2017) Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations; Jacobs, J.S., Bean, C.P., Fine particles, thin films and exchange anisotropy (1963) Magnetism, 3, p. 271350. , G.

The Intensification of Neural Networks in Machine learning playing major revolution in Machine Translation (MT). Looking same aspect, we have prepared a paper on Machine Translation for Hindi using Neural Machine Translation techniques. The Basis of this paper is to translate the source language into target language with the help of sentence structure for source language (English sentence) and corresponding reordering rules for target language (Hindi sentence) using a deep neural network (DNN).When the source input that is English sentences are exactly matched with the target language database then the suitable translation for related input is directly fetched from the database. The fuzzy matching between the input sentence and the sample sentence in the database is done with cosine similarity between the sentence structure of input sentence and the sample sentence and then the reordering rule of the most alike sentence to the input sentence is used for translation.Extracting the structure of the source language sentence and extracting the reordering rule for target sentence is the core part of the translator. Reordering of words in spite of that remains one of the complex problems.It is exciting to implement Deep Neural Network and fuzzy logic to build intelligent reordering rules machine learning system. © 2019 IEEE.",Cosine similarity; Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); Machine learning; Machine translation (MT); Natural Language Processing (NLP); Recurrent Neural Network (RNN); Word2vec,Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Database systems; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Fuzzy neural networks; Intelligent computing; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Computational power; Cosine similarity; English sentences; Fuzzy matching; Machine translations; Sentence structures; Source language; Target language; Fuzzy logic,"Singh, S.P., Kumar, A., Machine translation using deep learning: An overview (2017) International Conference on Computer, Communications and Electronics; Larochelle, H., Bengio, Y., Louradour, J., Lamblin, P., Exploring strategies for training deep neural networks (2009) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 1. , submitted 12/07; https://deeplearning4j.org/restrictedboltzmannmachine.html; http://www.minerazzi.com/tutorials/cosine-similaritytutorial; http://deeplearning4j.org/word2vec.html; Http://www.Deeplearningbook.Org/; https://www.sas.com/en-us/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html; https://deeplearning4j.org/quickstart; Sivanandam, S.N., Principles of Soft Computing, , 2nd Edition",,Dr. A.P.J.

In addition, the feature words of the universities were analyzed, revealing the issues facing each of them. © 2019 IEEE.",feature word; institutional research; logic model; machine learning; medium-term goal and plan; Text mining,Automatic estimation; Feature words; Logic modeling; Logic models; Medium term; Third phase; Computer circuits,"Kawaguchi, A., (2006) Wakariyasui Daigaku Hyouka No Gihou, , National Institution for Academic Degrees and University Evaluation, Gyousei; Oishi, T., Takata, E., Seki, T., Mori, M., Sekiguchi, M., Proposing methods of support by ir for japanese national universities on the mid-term plan related to globalization (2018) ASEAN Journal of Education, 4 (2), pp. 41-46. , Dec; Morozumi, A., Faculty participation in university decision making and management in Japan (2015) Mass Higher Education Development in East Asia, pp. 325-341. , Shin J., Postiglione G., Huang F., Springer; Eiichi, T., (2018) Analysis of the Current Situation Using a Logic Model of Planning and Evaluation in National Universities and the Way of Support with Institutional Research, , Daigaku IR shuuchuu koushuukai, Jan, Japanese; Oishi, T., Takata, E., Kuwano, N., Seki, T., Mori, M., Sekiguchi, M., How can ir support the management of japanese national universities on the mid-term plan related to globalization (2017) The 17th Annual SEAAIR Conference, Proc.

However, multi-hop QA systems pose additional challenges that these memory networks cannot comfortably handle with their attention spans. Path-finding tasks are a flavor of such multi-hop QA, and it does not have the additional complexity of implicit reasoning. A directed knowledge graph of entities, built from any text corpus, can capture both direction and implicit reasoning. This work attempts to address the bottleneck faced by sophisticated memory network implementations on a dataset that is appropriate for solving such path-finding tasks over multiple hops. It uses the knowledge graph approach for the directional information to address the search challenge in path finding. The experiments conducted using this approach have produced impressive results and can be extended in the future for higher-order challenges that consist of implicit reasoning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Attention; bAbI dataset; Dynamic memory network; End to end memory network; Graph linearization; Knowledge graph; Path finding task; Question answering,,"Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., (2014) Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate.

Natural language instructions typically identify only a few high-level decisions and landmarks rather than complete low-level motor behaviors; much of the missing information must be inferred based on perceptual context. In machine learning settings, this is doubly challenging: it is difficult to collect enough annotated data to enable learning of this reasoning process from scratch, and also difficult to implement the reasoning process using generic sequence models. Here we describe an approach to vision-and-language navigation that addresses both these issues with an embedded speaker model. We use this speaker model to (1) synthesize new instructions for data augmentation and to (2) implement pragmatic reasoning, which evaluates how well candidate action sequences explain an instruction. Both steps are supported by a panoramic action space that reflects the granularity of human-generated instructions. Experiments show that all three components of this approach-speaker-driven data augmentation, pragmatic reasoning and panoramic action space-dramatically improve the performance of a baseline instruction follower, more than doubling the success rate over the best existing approach on a standard benchmark. © 2018 Curran Associates Inc..All rights reserved.",,Benchmarking; High level languages; Learning systems; Navigation; Action sequences; Data augmentation; Missing information; Natural languages; Reasoning problems; Reasoning process; Sequence models; Three component; Air navigation,"Anderson, P., Wu, Q., Teney, D., Bruce, J., Johnson, M., Sünderhauf, N., Reid, I., Van Der Hengel, A., Vision-and-language navigation: Interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions in real environments (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); Andreas, J., Klein, D., Alignment-based compositional semantics for instruction following (2015) Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP); Andreas, J., Klein, D., Reasoning about pragmatics with neural listeners and speakers (2016) Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP); Artzi, Y., Zettlemoyer, L., Weakly supervised learning of semantic parsers for mapping instructions to actions (2013) Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1 (1), pp. 49-62; Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate (2015) Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR); Blum, A., Mitchell, T., Combining labeled and unlabeled data with co-training (1998) Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory, pp. 92-100; Branavan, S., Chen, H., Zettlemoyer, L.S., Barzilay, R., Reinforcement learning for mapping instructions to actions (2009) Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pp. 82-90. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Chang, A., Dai, A., Funkhouser, T., Halber, M., Niessner, M., Savva, M., Song, S., Zhang, Y., Matterport3D: Learning from rgb-d data in indoor environments (2017) International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV); Chen, D.L., Fast online lexicon learning for grounded language acquisition (2012) Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Long Papers - Volume 1, ACL'12, pp. 430-439. , Stroudsburg, PA, USA, Association for Computational Linguistics; Chen, K., Kovvuri, R., Nevatia, R., Query-guided regression network with context policy for phrase grounding (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV); Cirik, V., Berg-Kirkpatrick, T., Morency, L.-P., Using syntax to ground referring expressions in natural images (2018) 32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18); Cohn-Gordon, R., Goodman, N., Potts, C., Pragmatically informative image captioning with character-level reference (2018) Proceedings of the Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL); Das, A., Datta, S., Gkioxari, G., Lee, S., Parikh, D., Batra, D., Embodied question answering (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); Frank, M.C., Goodman, N.D., Predicting pragmatic reasoning in language games (2012) Science, 336 (6084), p. 998; Frank, M.C., Goodman, N.D., Lai, P., Tenenbaum, J.B., Informative communication in word production and word learning (2009) Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society; Fried, D., Andreas, J., Klein, D., Unified pragmatic models for generating and following instructions (2018) Proceedings of the Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL); Goodman, N.D., Stuhlmüller, A., Knowledge and implicature: Modeling language understanding as social cognition (2013) Topics in Cognitive Science, 5 (1), pp. 173-184; Grice, H.P., Logic and conversation (1975) Syntax and Semantics: Vol. 3: Speech Acts, pp. 41-58. , Cole and J.

We use a probabilistic logic programming framework that can learn probabilities for rules from positive and negative example interpretations. These rules are then used by a meta-interpreter to generate an explanation in the form of a proof for a why-question. The explanation is displayed as an answer to the question together with a probability. In certain contexts, follow-up questions can be asked that conditionally depend on these why-questions and have an effect on the probability of the subsequent answer. The presented approach is a contribution to explainable artificial intelligence that aims to take machine learning out of the black-box. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Meta-interpreter; Natural language processing; Probabilistic logic programming; why-questions,Artificial intelligence; Computer circuits; Learning algorithms; Logic programming; Natural language processing systems; Probability; Program interpreters; Black boxes; Follow up; Meta-interpreters; NAtural language processing; Negative examples; Novel architecture; Question answering systems; why-questions; Probabilistic logics,"Bellodi, E., Riguzzi, F., Structure learning of probabilistic logic programs by searching the clause space (2015) Theor.

In this preliminary work we present an alternative approach to developing a QA system using machine learning that relies on the automatic generation of a QA grammar from a lemon lexicon. This model-based approach comes with a number of advantages compared to a machine learning approach. First, our approach gives maximum control over the QA interface to the developer of the system as every entry added to the lexicon increases the coverage of the grammar and thus of the QA system in a predictable way. This is in contrast to machine learning approaches where the impact of the addition of a single training example is difficult to predict. A further advantage of our approach is that the QA system operates on the basis of a symbolic grammar that can be used to provide guidance and auto-completion functionality to users. Our system is indeed intended to be used in the context of an auto-completion interface that allows users to ask only questions that the grammar can cover. We present very preliminary results showing that a large percentage of the questions of the training set of QALD-7 can be rephrased in terms of questions that our grammar can parse. We show that with a hand-crafted lexicon, we can in principle get very high micro-F1 scores of 62.5% on the training data of QALD-7 when questions are manually rephrased to fit our grammar. Although these preliminary results do not constitute a proper evaluation of our approach, they hint at the fact that an approach as we propose seems feasible.

New sentence templates are added to define culturally-specific temporal and spatial names. Two kinds of queries are supported: (1) proximity queries, and (2) relational (e.g., overlap or containment) queries. Proximity queries require concepts grounded in terms of absolute time (UTC times) or location (latitude and longitude). Relational queries can be answered using Allen's Interval Algebra, for time; or Region Connection Calculus (RCC-8), for regions. Our motivation for handling proximity queries is to allow easy feature definition for a machine learning algorithm that detects anomalous vehicle travel. Our motivation for addressing more general, relational queries is to improve CPL's modeling of the temporal and spatial relationships of events and objects that occur in sentences, in order to further improve its semantic reasoning capabilities in applications such as Q&A. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Allen's Interval Algebra; controlled natural language; CPL; inverse reinforcement learning; RCC-8; spatiotemporal reasoning,Allen's interval algebra; Controlled natural language; CPL; Inverse reinforcement learning; RCC-8; Spatio-temporal reasoning; Motivation; Reinforcement learning; Learning algorithms,"Clark, P., Harrison, P., Jenkins, T., Thompson, J., Wojcik, R., Acquiring and Using World Knowledge using a Restricted Subset of English (2005) The 18th International FLAIRS Conference, FLAIRS 2005; Ng, A., Russell, S., Algorithms for inverse reinforcement learning Proceedings of ICML (2000); Singliar, T., Marginenantu, D., Scaling up Inverse Reinforcement Learning through Instructed Feature Construction Snowbird Learning Workshop (2011), , http://snowbird.djvuzone.org/2011/abstracts/132.pdf; Kövecses, Z., (2002) Metaphor: A Practical Introduction, , Oxford University Press, USA; Kövecses, Z., (2005) Metaphor in Culture: Universality and Variation, , Cambridge University Press; Kövecses, Z., (2006) Language, Mind, and Culture: A Practical Introduction, , Oxford University Press, USA; Lakoff, G., (1990) Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things, , University of Chicago Press; Fuchs, N.E., Schwertel, U., Schwitter, R., Attempto Controlled English - Not Just Another Logic Specification Language (1999) LNCS, 1559, pp. 1-20. , Flener, P.

In this paper, we have demonstrated a Recognizing Textual Entailment wherein the task is to recognize whether a given hypothesis is true (Entailment), false (Contradiction) or unrelated(neutral) with respect to the sentence called premise. The task is performed by training MNLI corpus along with the manually collected dataset from Amazon Product Reviews each having hypothesis and premise pairs with corresponding labels.

A key element of this success has been the development of new loss functions, like the popular cross-entropy loss, which has been shown to provide faster convergence and to reduce the vanishing gradient problem in very deep structures. While the cross-entropy loss is usually justified from a probabilistic perspective, this paper shows an alternative and more direct interpretation of this loss in terms of t-norms and their associated generator functions, and derives a general relation between loss functions and t-norms. In particular, the presented work shows intriguing results leading to the development of a novel class of loss functions. These losses can be exploited in any supervised learning task and which could lead to faster convergence rates that the commonly employed cross-entropy loss. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Learning from constraints; Loss functions; T-Norms,Computer circuits; Deep learning; Entropy; Fuzzy logic; Natural language processing systems; Class of loss functions; Deep structure; Faster convergence; General relations; Generator function; Loss functions; NAtural language processing; Vanishing gradient; Inductive logic programming (ILP),"Bach, S.H., Broecheler, M., Huang, B., Getoor, L., Hinge-loss markov random fields and probabilistic soft logic (2017) J.

AI broadly covers a wide swath of techniques which include logic-based approaches, probabilistic graphical models, and machine learning/deep learning approaches. Advances in hardware capabilities, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), software components (e.g., accelerated libraries, programming frameworks), and systems infrastructures (e.g., GPU-enabled cloud providers) has led to a wide-spread adaptation of AI techniques to a variety of domains. Examples of such domains include image classification, autonomous driving, automatic speech recognition (ASR) and conversational systems (chatbots). AI techniques not only support multiple datatypes (e.g., free text, images, or speech), but are also available in various configurations, from personal devices to large-scale distributed systems. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Artificial Intelligence; Database Systems; Machine Learning; Neural Networks,Artificial intelligence; Computer graphics; Database systems; Graphics processing unit; Information management; Learning systems; Machine learning; Neural networks; Program processors; Speech recognition; Artificial intelligence techniques; Automatic speech recognition; Conversational systems; International workshops; Large-scale distributed system; Logic-based approach; Probabilistic graphical models; Programming framework; Distributed computer systems,,,ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD),Association for Computing Machinery,"2019 International Conference on Management of Data, SIGMOD 2019",30 June 2019 through 5 July 2019,,149182,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069494645

This problem becomes especially acute for systems that have to deal with massive amount of data as inputs in the form of sentences/commands/phrase as a large number of such phrases may look vastly different in lexical and grammatical structure but yet convey similar meanings. In this paper, we describe a novel approach involving Artificial Neural Network to sufficiently solve the aforesaid problem for inputs in English language. The proposed system uses Self Organizing Map (SOM) to recognize and classify the input sentences into classes representing phrases/sentences having similar meaning. After Detailed analysis and evaluation, we have been able to reach a maximum efficiency of approximately 92.5% for the system. The proposed expert system could be extended to be used in the development of efficient and robust systems like intelligent medical systems, Systems for Intelligent Web-Browsing, telemarketing and several others which will be able to take text input in the form commands/ sentences in natural languages to give suitable output. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.",Artificial neural networks; Knowledge discovery; Machine learning; Natural language reasoning; Self organizing maps; Sentence recognition,Analysis and evaluation; Computational system; English languages; Grammatical structure; Maximum Efficiency; Medical systems; Natural languages; Robust systems; Self-organizing map (SOM); Sentence recognition; System use; Text input; Computer science; Data mining; Expert systems; Information technology; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Self organizing maps; Problem solving,"Fayyad, U.M., Shapiro, G.P., Smyth, P., From data mining to knowledge discovery: An overview (1996) Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, , AAAI Press, Menlo Park; Tan, P.N., Steinbach, M., Kumar, V., (2005) Introduction to Data Mining, , Pearson Addison Wesley; Dunham, M.H., (2003) Data Mining Introductory and Advanced Topics, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs; Jain, A.K., Murthy, M.N., Flynn, P.L., Data clustering: A review (1999) ACM Computing Surveys, 31 (3), pp. 264-323; Anderberg, M.R., Cluster Analysis for Application, , Academic Press, London; Rasmussen, E., (1992) Clustering Algorithms in Information Retrieval: Data Structures and Algorithms, , W.

In information retrieval tasks we typically deal with query-document pairs, in question answering - question-answer pairs. However, before learning can take place, such pairs needs to be mapped from the original space of symbolic words into some feature space encoding various aspects of their relatedness, e.g. lexical, syntactic and semantic. Feature engineering is often a laborious task and may require external knowledge sources that are not always available or difficult to obtain. Recently, deep learning approaches have gained a lot of attention from the research community and industry for their ability to automatically learn optimal feature representation for a given task, while claiming state-of-the-art performance in many tasks in computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network architecture for reranking pairs of short texts, where we learn the optimal representation of text pairs and a similarity function to relate them in a supervised way from the available training data. Our network takes only words in the input, thus requiring minimal preprocessing. In particular, we consider the task of reranking short text pairs where elements of the pair are sentences. We test our deep learning system on two popular retrieval tasks from TREC: Question Answering and Microblog Retrieval. Our model demonstrates strong performance on the first task beating previous state-of-the-art systems by about 3% absolute points in both MAP and MRR and shows comparable results on tweet reranking, while enjoying the benefits of no manual feature engineering and no additional syntactic parsers. © 2015 ACM.",Convolutional neural networks; Learning to rank; Microblog search; Question answering,Computer vision; Convolution; Information retrieval; Network architecture; Neural networks; Query processing; Semantics; Speech recognition; Syntactics; Convolutional neural network; Feature representation; Learning to rank; Micro-blog; NAtural language processing; Question Answering; State-of-the-art performance; State-of-the-art system; Natural language processing systems,"Agarwal, A., Raghavan, H., Subbian, K., Melville, P., Gondek, D., Lawrence, R., Learning to rank for robust question answering (2012) CIKM; Antoine Bordes, J.W., Usunier, N., Open question answering with weakly supervised embedding models (2014) ECML, , Nancy, France, September; Bengio, Y., Ducharme, R., Vincent, P., Jauvin, C., A neural probabilistic language model (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 1137-1155; Berendsen, R., Tsagkias, M., Weerkamp, W., De Rijke, M., Pseudo test collections for training and tuning microblog rankers (2013) SIGIR; Bordes, A., Chopra, S., Weston, J., Question answering with subgraph embeddings (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 615-620. , Doha, Qatar, October, Association for Computational Linguistics; Cao, Z., Qin, T., Liu, T.-Y., Tsai, M.-F., Li, H., Learning to rank: From pairwise approach to listwise approach (2007) Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML'07, pp. 129-136. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Chen, Y., Zhou, M., Wang, S., Reranking answers from definitional QA using language models (2006) ACL; Collobert, R., Weston, J., A unified architecture for natural language processing: Deep neural networks with multitask learning (2008) ICML, pp. 160-167; Cui, H., Kan, M., Chua, T., Generic soft pattern models for definitional QA (2005) SIGIR, , Salvador, Brazil, ACM; Deerwester, S., Dumais, S., Furnas, G., Landauer, T., Harshman, R., Indexing by latent semantic analysis (1990) Journal of the American Society of Information Science; Denil, M., Demiraj, A., Kalchbrenner, N., Blunsom, P., De Freitas, N., (2014) Modelling, Visualising and Summarising Documents with a Single Convolutional Neural Network, , Technical report, University of Oxford; Duchi, J., Hazan, E., Singer, Y., Adaptive subgradient methods for online learning and stochastic optimization (2011) J.

Users use Twitter to convey their tweet to the general public. The number of Twitter users has reached 330 million people worldwide. Besides that, in Twitter there are tweets that can be sentiments. Sentiment itself can be defined as policy, opinion, logic, or mud, etc. Therefore, sentiment analysis is determining the polarity or type of opinion in a predetermined text or subject. NLP (Natural Language Processing) technique is used to support the beginning of a text. The technique used in an analysis is tokenization sentiment, elimination of stop words, and stemming. This study focuses on developing sentiment analysis using lexicons and multiplication polarity. Accuracy results are still smaller than using machine learning. Therefore, this lexicon needs to be improved in terms of its semantics. © 2019 IEEE.",Lexicon; NLP; Sentiment analysis; Twitter,Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Semantics; Sentiment analysis; General publics; Lexicon; Lexicon-based; Nlp (natural language processing); Social media; Stop word; Tokenization; Twitter; Social networking (online),"Yoo, S.Y., Song, J.I., Jeong, O.R., Social media contents based sentiment analysis and prediction system Expert Syst.

Many of these systems have fundamental limitations. Most return minimally interactive visualizations in response to queries and often require experts to perform modeling for a set of predicted user queries before the systems are effective. Eviza provides a natural language interface for an interactive query dialog with an existing visualization rather than starting from a blank sheet and asking closed-ended questions that return a single text answer or static visualization. The system employs a probabilistic grammar based approach with predefined rules that are dynamically updated based on the data from the visualization, as opposed to computationally intensive deep learning or knowledge based approaches. The result of an interaction is a change to the view (e.g., filtering, navigation, selection) providing graphical answers and ambiguity widgets to handle ambiguous queries and system defaults. There is also rich domain awareness of time, space, and quantitative reasoning built in, and linking into existing knowledge bases for additional semantics. Eviza also supports pragmatics and exploring multimodal interactions to help enhance the expressiveness of how users can ask questions about their data during the flow of visual analysis. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Ambiguity; Natural language; Parser; Pragmatics; Probabilistic grammar; Visual data analysis; Visualization,Data visualization; Flow visualization; Knowledge based systems; Natural language processing systems; Query processing; Semantics; User interfaces; Visualization; Ambiguity; Natural languages; Parser; Pragmatics; Probabilistic grammars; Visual data analysis; Visual languages,"Extended Backus-Naur Form, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form; I-want-to-go moments: From search to store, https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/i-want-to-go-micro-moments.html; IBM Watson Analytics, http://www.ibm.com/analytics/watson-analytics; Microsoft Q & A, https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-service-q-and-a; NarrativeScience, https://www.narrativescience.com/quill; Node.js®, https://nodejs.org; ThoughtSpot, http://www.thoughtspot.com; Turf: Advanced geospatial analysis for browsers and node, http://turfjs.org; WolframAlpha, https://www.wolframalpha.com; Allen, J., Recognizing intentions from natural language utterances (1982) Computational Models of Discourse, , M.

While many solutions so far are based on machine learning and natural language processing, we believe that a knowledgebased approach is better suited. In particular, we propose to employ a logic for conditional beliefs that is capable of dealing with incomplete or even inconsistent information (which commonsense knowledge often is). It does so by formalising the observation that humans often reason by picturing different contingencies of what the world could be like, and then choose to believe what is thought to be most plausible. We discuss and evaluate an implementation where relevant commonsense background information is obtained from the ConceptNet semantic network, translated into our formalism, and processed by a reasoner for our logic. © 2017 CEUR-WS.

However, most general neural sequence models do not explicitly capture such structural information, limiting their performance on these tasks. In this paper, we propose a new encoder-decoder model based on a structured neural representation, Tensor Product Representations (TPRs), for mapping Natural-language problems to Formal-language solutions, called TPN2F. The encoder of TP-N2F employs TPR 'binding' to encode natural-language symbolic structure in vector space and the decoder uses TPR 'unbinding' to generate, in symbolic space, a sequential program represented by relational tuples, each consisting of a relation (or operation) and a number of arguments. TP-N2F considerably outperforms LSTM-based seq2seq models on two benchmarks and creates new state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies show that improvements can be attributed to the use of structured TPRs explicitly in both the encoder and decoder. Analysis of the learned structures shows how TPRs enhance the interpretability of TP-N2F. © 2020 37th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2020.

It provides the systems with the ability to learn automatically and perform independently without being programmed. When concentrating on the machine learning project choosing an algorithm is one of the most important steps. Machine learning algorithms are the math and logic that adjust the training of the model and the performance. When it comes to a machine learning project the choosing a correct algorithm for implementing the model is a big task. If the developer doesn't choose the suitable and most efficient algorithm for the program the accuracy of the program can be decreased. When we look at these machine learning algorithms there is no solution or no approach that fits for all. Several factors affect when choosing a machine learning algorithm such as the number of data, type of the problem.etc. Most of the time a developer chooses the machine learning algorithm using his prior experience or analyzing several past similar projects. However, when it comes to a beginner it can be a tough experience. Most of the time beginners try with several algorithmic approaches to implement their model without any understanding. However, to avoid this there is no proper solution.Therefore here in this research, proposed an NLP and graph analytics-based approach for recommending a machine learning algorithm for a project. The summary of the proposed solution is here it analyzes past algorithms used in machine learning projects which are stored in a graph using NLP based keyword analysis and recommend the most suitable algorithmic approach. When the user inputs his project idea by using the Natural Language processing it generates keywords for the project description. Thereafter the system analyzes the graph which stores past machine learning projects and used technologies to find the most suitable algorithmic approach to the users' project. Moreover, it shows how the proposed algorithms were used in past similar projects. Therefore by using this system the developers can get a clear idea of the algorithm approach that they need to choose. © 2020 IEEE.",big-data; graph analysis; machine learning; NLP,Graph algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Teaching; Turing machines; User experience; Algorithm approaches; Algorithmic approach; Graph analytics; NAtural language processing; Number of datum; Prior experience; User input; Learning algorithms,"Odsc, , https://opendatascience.com/help-set-The-standards-foranalytics-professionals-for-A-chance-To-win-data-science-gifts/, Help Set the Standards for Analytics Professionals For a Chance to Win Data Science Gifts ODSC 12 4 2019 [Accessed 1 5 2020]; Lindner, C., Where Do Data Scientists Come From?

'Exobrain' is a Korean Research Program which aims at building such a high-performing QA system for the Korean Language. In this paper, we describe 'Brochette', a continuous learning platform that iteratively acquires a large volume of unstructured data and extracts sentences related to entries of an ontology, a formal representation of knowledge used for further queries and reasoning purposes. As various Machine Learning modules must be trained and tuned to suit new content and adapt to new domains, Brochette platform also provides a framework for continuously re-training and evaluating machine learning components for syntactic and semantic analysis. Integrating semantic information from the ontology and results of these machine learners, the system is able to discover new knowledge which is then incorporated again in the Knowledge Base, making it continuously evolving.

This emerging field can be applied in diverse domains and is currently being investigated with different techniques. A program synthesizer would simplify the efforts of programmers and help them focus on the program's core logic, without worrying about language syntax and other domain specifics. We applied the concepts of program synthesis in the context of solving a propositional logic word problem. We have developed a tool that is capable of understanding, parsing and evaluating a propositional logic word problem. With the user's natural language input, this tool processes the query and evaluates truth values of the question expressions. The working of the tool can be explained in three major phases: natural language processing, machine learning to obtain postfix notations of the Boolean expressions involved, and further evaluation of the postfix notations to determine the answers. Our goal was to explore the domain agnostic capabilities of our program-synthesis-based techniques of learning used in the implementation of this tool. © 2021 IEEE.",boolean; natural language processing; program synthesis; propositional logic; sequence-to-sequence model,Computer circuits; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Syntactics; Boolean; Core logic; Diverse domains; Domain specific; Language syntax; Program synthesis; Propositional logic; Sequence models; Sequence-to-sequence model; Word problem; Formal logic,"Gulwani, S., Automating string processing in spreadsheets using inputoutput examples (2011) Microsoft Research, , https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/popl11-synthesis.pdf; Chen, X., Liu, C., Song, D., (2011) Towards Synthesizing Complex Programs from Input-output Examples, , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01284.pdf; Sundaram, S.S., Khemani, D., (2015) Natural Language Processing for Solving Simple Word Problems, , https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W15-5955/; Lample, G., Charton, F., Deep learning for symbolic mathematics (2019) Facebook Ai Research, , https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01412; Program syn thesis Microsoft Research, , https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/programsynthesisnow.pdf; Infix to Postfix, , https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-set-2-infix-to-postfix/; Encoder Decoder Model, , https://machinelearningmastery.com/encoder-decoder-recurrent-neural-network-models-neural-machine-translation/; Postfix Evaluation, , https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-set-4-evaluation-postfix-expression/; Dfs Algo, , https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-search-or-dfs-for-a-graph/; Singh, R., Solar-Lezama, A., (2011) Data Structure Manipulation, , https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/papers/SinghS11.pdf; Albarghouthi, A., Gulwani, S., Kincaid, Z., (2013) Recursive Program Synthesis, , http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aws/papers/cav13a.pdf; Solar-Lezama, A., (2009) The Sketching Approach to Program Synthesis, , https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/papers/Solar-Lezama09.pdf",,,IEEE,"2021 Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology, ASIANCON 2021",28 August 2021 through 29 August 2021,,172291,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117593395

The quality of the type systems used for annotation affects the quality of annotation. To achieve highly accepted sets of annotated documents, the Fleiss’ kappa score has been widely used to observe the level of agreement from annotated results, submitted by different human annotators. The challenge is that the kappa score cannot be used to validate the type systems nor to identify any incorrect annotations. Thus, we proposed an application of formal logic for validating type systems and annotations against expert rules. Experiments have been done by using four different type systems and annotation sets created by an expert and three novices. Our proposed formal logic model was used to validate the novice type systems and annotations against the expert rules. The results show that the technique could help identifying inconsistencies between expert and novice annotations, by using a model checker. The number of detected inconsistencies impacts the level of achieved F1 score. Thus, the proposed formal logic technique could be used to guide novice annotators to develop accepted type systems. This will help to enhance the performance of the generated machine learning models used by the NLU. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",IBM watson; Inconsistency detection; Natural language understanding; Validation,Application programs; Model checking; Expert and novices; IBM watson; Inconsistency detection; Machine learning models; Model checker; Natural language understanding; Type systems; Validation; Computer circuits,"Kulkarni, R., Kulkarni, H., Balar, K., Krishna, P., Cognitive natural language search using calibrated quantum mesh (2019) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 880. , ed; Sheth, A., Perera, S., Wijeratne, S., Thirunarayan, K., Knowledge will propel machine understanding of content: Extrapolating from current examples (2017) Proceedings - 2017 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence, WI 2017; (2018) IBM Watson Knowledge Studio, , https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/knowledge-studio/; Stevens, R., Lord, P., Malone, J., Matentzoglu, N., Measuring expert performance at manually classifying domain entities under upper ontology classes (2018) Journal of Web Semantics; Green, C.C., Raphael, B., Use of theorem - Proving techniques in question - Answering systems (1968) Proc 23rd Nat Conf, pp. 169-181. , Article; Bos, J., Applying automated deduction to natural language understanding (2009) Journal of Applied Logic, 7 (1), pp. 100-112. , Article; Furbach, U., Glöckner, I., Pelzer, B., An application of automated reasoning in natural language question answering (2010) Journal of AI Communications, 23 (2-3), pp. 241-265; Bundy, A., Nuamah, K., Lucas, C., Automated reasoning in the age of the internet (2018) Cham, pp. 3-18. , Springer; (2018) Amazon Comprehend, , https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/; (2019) Microsoft Cognitive Services: Languange Understanding (LUIS), , https://www.luis.ai/home; (2019) Google Natural Language Understanding Research, , https://www.kaggle.com/google-nlu; Manning, C., Surdeanu, M., Bauer, J., Finkel, J., Bethard, S., McClosky, D., The Stanford CoreNLP natural language processing toolkit (2014) Proceedings of 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 55-60; (2018) Natural Language Understanding, , https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/natural-languageunderstanding/, 5 Jan 2019; Fan, F., Nguyen, V., Xie, J., (2017) Theorem Proving with Natural Language Inference; Gervasi, V., Zowghi, D., Reasoning about inconsistencies in natural language requirements (2005) ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, 14 (3). , Article; Simko, V., Hauzar, D., Hnetynka, P., Bures, T., Plasil, F., Formal verification of annotated textual use-cases (2015) Computer Journal, 58 (7), pp. 1495-1529. , Article",,University of New Brunswick,ICST,"8th International Conference on Software and Computer Applications, ICSCA 2019",19 February 2019 through 21 February 2019,,147956,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066045737

The usage of microtext poses a considerable performance issue to sentiment analysis, since models are trained on standard words. This paper discusses the impact of coupling sub-symbolic (phonetics) with symbolic (machine learning) Artificial Intelligence to transform the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) concepts into their standard in-vocabulary (IV) form. We develop binary classifier to detect OOV sentences and then they are transformed to phoneme subspace using grapheme to phoneme converter. We compare the phonetic and string distance using the Sorensen similarity algorithm. The phonetically similar IV concepts thus obtained are then used to compute the correct polarity value, which was previously being miscalculated because of the presence of microtext. Our proposed framework improves the accuracy of polarity detection by 6% as compared to the earlier model. In conclusion, we apply a grapheme to phoneme converter for microtext normalization and show its application on sentiment analysis. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Concept level sentiment analysis; G2P; IPA; Microtext normalization; Phonetics,Artificial intelligence; Linguistics; Speech analysis; Binary classifiers; Cognitive approaches; Concept levels; Grapheme-to-phoneme converters; Microtext normalization; Performance issues; Similarity algorithm; Social media platforms; Sentiment analysis,"Aw, A., Zhang, M., Xiao, J., Su, J., A phrase-based statistical model for SMS text normalization (2006) ACL, pp. 33-40; Beaufort, R., Roekhaut, S., Cougnon, L.A.L., Fairon, C., A hybrid rule/model-based finite-state framework for normalizing SMS messages (2010) ACL, Pp. 770–779.

We applied the machine learning for those extracted sentences to identify the characteristic (feature) words and pattern of each viewpoint. It turned out that the activities have simple pattern and can be recognized with high identification performance. However, the output and the outcome are hard to describe the viewpoints. © 2019 IEEE.",feature word; institutional research; logic model; machine learning; midterm goal and plan; text mining,Computer circuits; Learning systems; Machine learning; Feature words; Logic modeling; Logic models; midterm goal and plan; Text mining,"Oishi, T., Takata, E., Seki, T., Mori, M., Sekiguchi, M., Proposing methods of support by ir for Japanese national universities on the mid-term plan related to globalization (2018) ASEAN Journal of Education, 4 (2), pp. 41-46. , Dec; Morozumi, A., Faculty participation in university decision making and management in Japan (2015) Mass Higher Education Development in East Asia, pp. 325-341. , In: Shin J. , Postiglione G. , Huang F.

One of the most popular technique applied in sentiment analysis of textual content is natural language processing. Sentiment can be evaluated using numerous methodologies like machine learning algorithms and statistical tools but the use of the fuzzy concept is not common. In this paper, we analyze the effect of fuzzification of word polarity sentiment scores. These word scores are obtained by deploying two lexicons: SentiWordNet and AFINN. Experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets: polarity movie dataset by Pang-Lee, IMDB and hotel reviews dataset. The key highlights are: i) proposed an unsupervised fuzzy logic-based approach for sentiment analysis of textual reviews, ii) the proposed model formulated fuzzy cardinality as the measure for the evaluation of word polarity scores, iii) our model has two versions based on the sentiment lexicon deployed in the model, iv) comparison of our fuzzy cardinality approach with other non-fuzzy state-of-the-art methods reveals the superiority of our fuzzy approach. © 2020 IEEE.",AFINN;

However, the results in these two research fields have serious drawbacks. The solutions offered by neural networks remain unstable and prone to adversarial attacks: while the percentage of correct answers increases, the incorrect answers often contain glaring errors. Large knowledge graphs contain a lot of facts but little knowledge; they are mostly used for information search and retrieval. The ability to reason conclusions on them is limited, and the majority of modern research turns to approximate methods like neural networks and graph embeddings to draw conclusions and use the accumulated knowledge. In this work, I propose a hybrid cognitive architecture inspired by the observable features of human thinking. Pruning obviously wrong solutions seems to be more natural for human symbolic reasoning than making far-fetched strict logical conclusions, while generating new ideas is often intuitive. So a hybrid cognitive architecture can employ generative neural networks as a sort of ""intuition"" (generating possible solutions) and symbolic inference as a control contour to verify and filter the generated solutions, weeding out dangerous and wrong ideas. This requires creating knowledge graphs containing negative information: the information of what cannot happen or should not be done and why. The problems of creating negative knowledge graphs are discussed. Hybrid cognitive systems using the proposed architecture will be a lot more trustworthy as they will have a system of human-verifiable rules that ensures avoiding the worst errors which can be used in many fields from decision making to natural-language parsing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V..

However, the interpretability and accuracy problems have plagued QA systems for a long time. In this paper, we propose a QA system, DSQA, based on knowledge graph for answering domain-specific medical questions. The data we use are from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) that are complex and heterogeneous with varied qualities. We introduce doctor-in-the-loop mechanism to design the knowledge graph, which improves the interpretability and the accuracy of our QA system. For every natural-language question, we generate the answer with a hybrid of the traditional deep learning model and the reasoning on the knowledge graph. Finally, the answer is returned to the user in the format of a subgraph with corresponding natural-language sentences. Our system shows high interpretability and gives excellent performance according to the experiment results. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Causality knowledge graph; Doctor-in-the-loop; EMR; QA System,Deep learning; Information use; Knowledge representation; Medical computing; Natural language processing systems; Electronic medical records (EMRs); Interpretability; Interpretability and accuracy; Knowledge graphs; Medical question answering; Natural language questions; Natural languages; Ordinary people; Medical information systems,"Alqifari, R., Question answering systems approaches and challenges (2019) Student Research Workshop, pp. 69-75. , https://doi.org/10.26615/issn.2603-2821.2019011; Ansong, S., Eteffa, K.F., Li, C., Sheng, M., Zhang, Y., Xing, C., How to empower disease diagnosis in a medical education system using knowledge graph (2019) WISA 2019.

In industry areas like customer support, complex incidents can be regarded as instances of a dynamic process since there can be no static planning against their unique nature. Support engineers will work with any means at their disposal to solve any emerging case and define a custom prioritization strategy, to achieve the best possible result. To assist with this, in this paper we describe a novel workflow application to address the tasks of high solution accuracy and shorter prediction resolution time. We describe how workflows can be generated to assist experts and how our solution can scale over time to produce domain-specific reusable cases for similar problems. Our work is evaluated using data from 5000 workflows from the automotive industry. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",Business processes; Case-based reasoning; Deep learning; Natural language processing,Automotive industry; Case based reasoning; Computer software reusability; Natural language processing systems; Business Process; Customer support; Domain specific; Dynamic business process; Shorter prediction; Solution accuracy; Unexpected incidents; Workflow applications; Deep learning,"Brynjolfsson, E., McElheran, K., (2016) Data in Action: Data-Driven Decision Making in U.S. Manufacturing, , Center for Economic Studies (CES); Aamodt, A., Plaza, E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches (1994) AI Commun, 1 (7), pp. 39-59; Chen, X.-W., Lin, X., Big data deep learning: Challenges and perspectives (2014) IEEE Access, 2, pp. 514-525; Bengio, Y., Deep learning of representations: Looking forward (2013) SLSP 2013.

As part of a larger project aimed at deepening our understanding of student processes for integrating multiple sources of information, we are developing machine learning and natural language processing techniques for evaluating students' argumentative essays. In previous work, we have focused on identifying conceptual elements of the essays. In this paper, we present a method for inferring the causal structure of student essays. We used a standard parser to derive grammatical dependencies of the essay and converted them to logic statements. Then a simple inference mechanism was used to identify concepts linked to syntactic connectors by these dependencies. The results suggest that we will soon be able to provide explicit feedback that enables teachers and students to improve comprehension. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Argumentation; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Reading,Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Syntactics; Argumentation; Automatic inference; Conceptual elements; Inference mechanism; Integrating multiple sources; NAtural language processing; Reading; Science and Technology; Students,"Bengio, Y., Ducharme, R., Vincent, P., Janvin, C., A neural probabilistic language model (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 1137-1155; Bird, S., Klein, E., Loper, E., (2009) Natural Language Processing with Python Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit, , OReilly; Chi, M., Roscoe, R., Slotta, J., Roy, M., Chase, C., Misconceived causal explanations for emergent processes (2012) Cognitive Science, 36, pp. 1-61; Cohen, R., Analyzing the structure of argumentative discourse (1987) Computational Linguistics, 13 (1-2), pp. 11-24; Collobert, R., Weston, J., A unified architecture for natural language processing: Deep neural networks with multitask learning (2008) ICML ACM, 307, pp. 160-167. , Cohen, W., McCallum, A., Roweis, S.

This can be especially important for the intelligence community and associated government agencies. In this paper, we explore methods to evaluate critical thinking and reasoning. We focus on a public opinion/argument-based website - Yourview. We introduce the Yourview platform and present the annotated Yourview dataset that was created following a pilot period that focused on collecting public opinion on a range of topics. We then propose a method to classify arguments and their components related to the comments in the Yourview dataset. We assess the influence of components of argumentation as the basis for critical thinking and subsequently score and visualize these relations. Building on this, we predict critical thinking scores for what makes a good argument using a multilayer perceptron (MLP).

We capture human motions by a Kinect camera and extract the time-series data of the motions from the videos. The time-series data are applied by several dimension reduction procedures and then turned to be the form which can be applied to machine learning. A pair of the analyzed time-series data and its intermediate representation which corresponds to the semantics of the human morion is learned by a log-linear model. As linguistic resources to generate a text, we collected various natural language expressions for human motions and build a bi-gram model for each motion. In our framework, once the intermediate representation is decided by observing time-series data; a proper bi-gram model corresponding to the intermediate representation is chosen; and then a text is generated by solving dynamic programming of the bi-gram model. Through experiments to generate texts describing human motions, we have confirmed that our proposed framework works well.",Bi-gram; Kinect; Probabilistic text generation; Symbolic Aggregation approXimaion(SAX); Time-series data,Artificial intelligence; Dynamic programming; Regression analysis; Semantics; Bi-gram; Kinect; Symbolic Aggregation approXimaion(SAX); Text generations; Time-series data; Computer science,"Ding, D., Metze, F., Rawat, S., Schulam, P.F., Burger, S., Generating natural language summaries for multimedia (2012) Proceedings of the Seventh International Natural Language Generation Conference, INLG'12, pp. 128-130. , Utica, Illinois; Ding, D., Metze, F., Rawat, S., Schulam, P.F., Burger, S., Younessian, E., Bao, L., Hauptmann, A., Beyond audio and video retrieval: Towards multimedia summarization (2012) Proceedings of the 2nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval, (2), pp. 1-8; Tan, C.C., Jiang, Y.-G., Ngo, C.-W., Towards textually describing complex video contents with audio-visual concept classifiers (2011) Proceedings of the 19th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 655-658; Kobayashi, I., Noumi, M., Hiyama, A., (2010) A Study on Verbalization of Human Behaviors in a Room FUZZ-IEEE 2010 Barcelona, , Spain, 18-23 July; Barbu, A., Bridge, A., Burchill, Z., Coroian, D., Dickinson, S., Fidler, S., Michaux, A., Zhang, Z., Video in sentences out (2012) Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI); Lapata, M., Probabilistic text structuring: Experiments with sentence ordering (2003) Proc. of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 545-552; Belz, A., Probabilistic generation of weather forecast texts (2007) Proceedings of NAACL HLT 2007, pp. 164-171; Belz, A., Kow, E., System building cost vs. Output quality in data-to-text generation (2009) Proceedings of the 12th European Workshop on Natural Language Generation (ENLG-09), pp. 16-24. , Athens, Greece; Lu, W., Hwee, T.Ng., Lee, W.S., Natural language generation with tree conditional random fields (2009) EMNLP, pp. 400-409; Liang, P., Jordan, M.I., Dan klein learning semantic correspondences with less supervision (2009) ACL-IJCNLP; Angeli, G., Liang, P., Klein, D., A simple domain-independent probabilistic approach to generation (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 502-512. , Cambridge, Massachusetts; Konstas, I., Lapata, M., Unsupervised concept-to-text generation with hypergraphs (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pp. 752-761. , Montreal, Canada; Konstas, I., Lapata, M., Concept-to-text generation via discriminative reranking, booktitle (2012) Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Long Papers, 1, pp. 369-378. , Jeju Island, Korea; http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/; Lin, J., Keogh, E., Lonardi, S., Chiu, B., (2003) A Symbolic Representation of Time Series, with Implications for Streaming Algorithms DMKD'03",,et al.;IAENG Society of Artificial Intelligence;IAENG Society of Bioinformatics;IAENG Society of Computer Science;IAENG Society of Data Mining;IAENG Society of Electrical Engineering,Newswood Limited,"2013 World Congress on Engineering and Computer Science, WCECS 2013",23 October 2013 through 25 October 2013,"San Francisco, CA",105838,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903446635

Given a natural language query and a few labeled webpages, our method synthesizes a program that can be used to extract similar types of information from other unlabeled webpages. To handle websites with diverse structure, our approach employs a neurosymbolic DSL that incorporates both neural NLP models as well as standard language constructs for tree navigation and string manipulation. We also propose an optimal synthesis algorithm that generates all DSL programs that achieve optimal F1 score on the training examples. Our synthesis technique is compositional, prunes the search space by exploiting a monotonicity property of the DSL, and uses transductive learning to select programs with good generalization power. We have implemented these ideas in a new tool called WebQA and evaluate it on 25 different tasks across multiple domains. Our experiments show that WebQA significantly outperforms existing tools such as state-of-the-art question answering models and wrapper induction systems. © 2021 ACM.",Program Synthesis; Programming by Example; Web Information Extraction,Air navigation; Computer programming languages; Digital subscriber lines; Natural language processing systems; Extracting information; Language constructs; Monotonicity property; Natural language queries; Optimal synthesis; Question Answering; Synthesis techniques; Transductive learning; Websites,"Agarwal, R., Srikant, R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules (1994) Proc.

The paper tracks some preliminary experiments obtained by employing a data-driven methodology that captures emotions, relying on domain data that you want to model. The experimentation consists of investigating the cor-responding conceptual space based on a set of terms (i.e., keywords) that are representative of the domain and the determination.

Such popularity is due to the fact that with the help of decision trees graphic models, text rules can be built and they are easily understood by the final user. Because of the inaccuracy of observations, uncertainties, the data, collected in the environment, often take an unclear form. Therefore, fuzzy decision trees are becoming popular in the field of machine learning. This article presents a method that includes the features of the two above-mentioned approaches: a graphical representation of the rules system in the form of a tree and a fuzzy representation of the data. The approach uses such advantages as high comprehensibility of decision trees and the ability to cope with inaccurate and uncertain information in fuzzy representation. The received learning method is suitable for classifying problems with both numerical and symbolic features. In the article, solution illustrations and numerical results are given.Also the comparison of fuzzy logic approaches for building fuzzy rules and classification trees are given. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

The main contribution of our work is investigations done namely on the very short (avg. ∼ 39 tokens) non-normative texts. With this paper we analyze a fundamental problem: how to choose automatic methods (in particular, classifiers and feature types) that could achieve the highest accuracy in our solving author profiling task (when the short pure text itself is the only evidence used for determining the author's meta-information). The related research analysis helped us to select the methods which demonstrated encouraging results on the other languages and to apply them on the Lithuanian dataset. Out of a number of experimentally investigated classifiers with lexical or symbolic features the Naïve Bayes Multinomial method with character ngrams (of n = [1, 5]) feature type yielded the best performance reaching 83.6% of the accuracy.

However, modern AI includes many different techniques, including machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, which are often not able to use knowledge graphs in their full size and complexity. Feature engineering, sampling, and simplification are needed, and commonly achieved with custom preprocessing code. In this position paper, we argue that a more principled integrated approach to this task is possible using declarative methods from knowledge representation and reasoning. In particular, we suggest that modern rule-based systems are a promising platform for computing customised views on knowledge graphs, and for integrating the results of other AI methods back into the overall knowledge model. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,Data mining; Graphic methods; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Feature engineerings; Integrated approach; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge representation and reasoning; NAtural language processing; Personal assistants; Public knowledge; Question Answering; Formal concept analysis,"Aberger, C.R., Tu, S., Olukotun, K., Ré, C., EmptyHeaded: A relational engine for graph processing (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 431-446. , Özcan, F., Koutrika, G., Madden, S.

People express their emotions, consciously or unconsciously, in their behaviors, like speech, facial expressions, textual content, and so on, whether it be in blogs, reviews, or on social media. Due to the rapid growth in textual social media to link people, the emotion extraction from textual data has attracted a lot of attention. This paper performs the sentence-level discrete emotion extraction from text by using Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNN) and Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNN). Much work has been presented to extracting emotion from textual data with precise and constant boundaries, but little of it has considered the inherent uncertainty in natural language. In other words, the high ambiguity of emotion in text data makes an emotionally sentence express multiple emotions at the same time. To deal with this uncertainty we use a Neuro Neural Network (NNN). But from another point of view, by increasing the number of inputs, the number of parameters in NNN growth exponentially. To this end, we extract a low-dimensional semantic representation of input sentence by using a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Our goal is to achieve better performance with combining the advantages of deep learning in high-level semantic feature extraction to ambiguity handling and the capabilities of fuzzy logic with fuzzy membership degrees to uncertainty handling. Experiments are conducted on the SemEval2007-Task14 dataset that contains 1250 annotated texts with Ekman’s basic emotions. The obtained results indicate that our proposed method outperforms the previous methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Bi-LSTM; Deep learning; Emotion extraction; Fuzzy Neural Network; Natural language processing; Word embedding,,"Agrawal, A., An, A., Unsupervised emotion detection from text using semantic and syntactic relations (2012) International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology, Vol. 1, Pp. 346–353.

In this setting, proofs correspond to the algorithm's output space, such as a path through a graph or a grammatical derivation, and are given a real-valued score (often interpreted as a probability) that depends on the real weights of the base axioms used in the proof. The desired output is a function over all possible proofs, such as a sum of scores or an optimal score. We describe the product transformation, which can merge two weighted logic programs into a new one. The resulting program optimizes a product of proof scores from the original programs, constituting a scoring function known in machine learning as a ""product of experts."" Through the addition of intuitive constraining side conditions, we show that several important dynamic programming algorithms can be derived by applying product to weighted logic programs corresponding to simpler weighted logic programs. In addition, we show how the computation of Kullback-Leibler divergence, an information-theoretic measure, can be interpreted using product. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.",natural language processing; program transformations; weighted logic programming,Bottom-up logic programming; Dynamic programming algorithm; Kullback Leibler divergence; Logic programs; NAtural language processing; Product of experts; Program transformations; Scoring functions; weighted logic programming; Computational linguistics; Information theory; Learning algorithms; Logic programming; Natural language processing systems; Dynamic programming,"Charniak, E., Knight, K., Yamada, K., Syntax-based language models for statistical machine translation (2003) Proc. of the MT Summit IX, , Association for Machine Translation in the Americas, Washington, DC; Chiang, D., Hierarchical phrase-based translation (2007) Computational Linguistics, 33 (2), pp. 201-228; Cocke, J., Schwartz, J.T., (1970) Programming Languages and Their Compilers: Preliminary Notes, , Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University; Cohen, S.B., Smith, N.A., Joint morphological and syntactic disambiguation (2007) Proc. of the 2007 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning, Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 208-217; Cortes, C., Mohri, M., Rastogi, A., Riley, M.D., Efficient computation of the relative entropy of probabilistic automata (2006) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 3887, pp. 323-336. , DOI 10.1007/11682462-32, LATIN 2006: Theoretical Informatics - 7th Latin American Symposium, Proceedings; Dempster, A., Laird, N., Rubin, D., Maximum likelihood estimation from incomplete data via the em algorithm (1977) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B, 39, pp. 1-38; Durbin, R., Eddy, S., Krogh, A., Mitchison, G., (1998) Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids, , Cambridge University Press; Eisner, J., Bilexical grammars and their cubic-time parsing algorithms (2000) Advances in Probabilistic and Other Parsing Technologies, pp. 29-62. , Harry Bunt and Anton Nijholt Eds.

Lately, the size of information on the internet is increasing. It has become tough for the users to dig into the loads of information to analyze it and draw conclusions. Text summarization solves this problem by generating a summary, selecting sentences which are most important from the document without losing the information. In this work, an approach for Extractive text summarization is designed and implemented for single document summarization. It uses a combination of Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Fuzzy Logic to select important sentences from the text still keeping the summary meaningful and lossless. The text documents used for summarization are in English language. Various sentence and word level features are used to provide meaningful sentences. Two summaries for each document are generated using Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Fuzzy logic. Both summaries are then combined and processed using a set of operations to get the final summary of the document. The results show that the designed approach overcomes the problem of text overloading by generating an effective summary. © 2018 IEEE.",Deep Learning; Extractive; Fuzzy logic; RBM; Sentence Features; Single document; Summarization; Unsupervised,Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Text processing; Extractive; Sentence features; Single document; Summarization; Unsupervised; Deep learning,"Luhn, H.P., The automatic creation of literature abstracts (1958) IBM Journal of Research Development, 2 (2), pp. 159-165; Baxendale, P., Machine-made index for technical literature-an experiment (1958) IBM Journal of Research Development, 2 (4), pp. 354-361; Edmundson, H.P., New methods in automatic extracting (1969) Journal of the ACM, 16 (2), pp. 264-285; Kupiec, J., Pedersen, J., Chen, F., A trainable document summarizer (1995) Proceedings SIGIR '95, pp. 68-73. , New York, NY, USA; McKeown, K.R., Radev, D.R., Generating summaries of multiple news articles (1995) Proceedings of SIGIR '95, pp. 74-82. , Seattle, Washington; Mani, I., Bloedorn, E., Multi-document summarization by graph search and matching (1997) AAAI/IAAI Cmplg/ 9712004, pp. 622-628; Conroy, J.M., O'Leary, D.P., Text summarization via hidden markov models (2001) Proceedings of SIGIR '01, pp. 406-407. , New York, NY, USA; Radev, D.R., Jing, H., Stys, M., Tam, D., Centroid-based summarization of multiple documents (2004) Information Processing and Management, 40, pp. 919-938; Evans, D.K., (2005) Similarity-based Multilingual Multidocument Summarization, , Technical Report CUCS-014-05, Columbia University; Babar, S.A., Patil, P.D., Improving performance of text summarization (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 46, pp. 354-363; Singh, S.P., Kumar, A., Mangal, A., Singhal, S., Bilingual automatic text summarization using unsupervised deep learning (2016) International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)-2016, pp. 1195-1200; Chopade, H.A., Narvekar, M., Hybrid auto text summarization using deep neural network and fuzzy logic system (2017) 2017 International Conference on Inventive Computing and Informatics (ICICI), Coimbatore, pp. 52-56. , India",,,IEEE,"4th International Conference on Computing, Communication Control and Automation, ICCUBEA 2018",16 August 2018 through 18 August 2018,,147581,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065159938

With the number of vulnerabilities discovered in the recent years surging, creating timely patches for every vulnerability is not always feasible. At the same time, not every vulnerability will be exploited by attackers; hence, prioritizing vulnerabilities by assessing the likelihood they will be exploited has become an important research problem. Recent works used machine learning techniques to predict exploited vulnerabilities by analyzing discussions about vulnerabilities on social media. These methods relied on traditional text processing techniques, which represent statistical features of words, but fail to capture their context. To address this challenge, we propose DarkEmbed, a neural language modeling approach that learns low dimensional distributed representations, i.e., embeddings, of darkweb/deepweb discussions to predict whether vulnerabilities will be exploited. By capturing linguistic regularities of human language, such as syntactic, semantic similarity and logic analogy, the learned embeddings are better able to classify discussions about exploited vulnerabilities than traditional text analysis methods. Evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of learned embeddings on both structured text (such as security blog posts) and unstructured text (darkweb/deepweb posts). DarkEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the exploit prediction task with an F1-score of 0.74. © 2018 Proceedings of the 30th Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference, IAAI 2018.

Recent works used machine learning techniques to predict exploited vulnerabilities by analyzing discussions about vulnerabilities on social media. These methods relied on traditional text processing techniques, which represent statistical features of words, but fail to capture their context. To address this challenge, we propose DarkEmbed, a neural language modeling approach that learns low dimensional distributed representations, i.e., embeddings, of darkweb/deepweb discussions to predict whether vulnerabilities will be exploited. By capturing linguistic regularities of human language, such as syntactic, semantic similarity and logic analogy, the learned embeddings are better able to classify discussions about exploited vulnerabilities than traditional text analysis methods. Evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of learned embeddings on both structured text (such as security blog posts) and unstructured text (darkweb/deepweb posts). DarkEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the exploit prediction task with an F 1 -score of 0.74.

To measure progress towards that goal, we argue for the usefulness of a set of proxy tasks that evaluate reading comprehension via question answering. Our tasks measure understanding in several ways: whether a system is able to answer questions via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many more. The tasks are designed to be prerequisites for any system that aims to be capable of conversing with a human. We believe many existing learning systems can currently not solve them, and hence our aim is to classify these tasks into skill sets, so that researchers can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their systems. We also extend and improve the recently introduced Memory Networks model, and show it is able to solve some, but not all, of the tasks. © ICLR 2016: San Juan, Puerto Rico.

The basic architecture for accomplishing this is using a CNN to extract features from the image and an RNN for the language processing, then combine the two in an MLP to produce an answer. These architectures perform well at identifying content, but fail at higher level reasoning such as spatial awareness and combining objects. To help remedy this, we propose using attention to divide the image into separate objects, then using the extracted features along with the location and size information to learn the MLP. © 2017 IEEE.",Deep Learning; Saliency; Visual Question Answering,Deep learning; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Visual languages; Complex problems; Language processing; Natural languages; Question Answering; Saliency; Spatial awareness; Image processing,"Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105; Sutskever, I., Vinyals, O., Le, Q.V., Sequence to sequence learning with neural networks (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3104-3112; Hochreiter, S., Schmidhuber, J., Long short-term memory (1997) Neural Computation, 9 (8), pp. 1735-1780; Lecun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., Haffner, P., Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition (1998) Proceedings of the IEEE, 86 (11), pp. 2278-2324; Malinowski, M., Rohrbach, M., Fritz, M., Ask your neurons: A neural-based approach to answering questions about images (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 1-9; Antol, S., Agrawal, A., Lu, J., Mitchell, M., Batra, D., Zitnick, C.L., Parikh, D., Vqa: Visual question answering (2015) International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV); Cudic, M., Burt, R., Santana, E., Principe, J., A flexible testing environment for visual question and answering with performance evaluation (2016) IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games (Under Review); Sillito, A.M., Cudeiro, J., Jones, H.E., Always returning: Feedback and sensory processing in visual cortex and thalamus (2006) Trends in Neurosciences, 29 (6), pp. 307-316; Buffalo, E.A., Fries, P., Landman, R., Liang, H., Desimone, R., A backward progression of attentional effects in the ventral stream (2010) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107 (1), pp. 361-365; Itti, L., Koch, C., Niebur, E., A model of saliency-based visual attention for rapid scene analysis (1998) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 20 (11), pp. 1254-1259; Tavakoli, H.R., Rahtu, E., Heikkilä, J., Fast and efficient saliency detection using sparse sampling and kernel density estimation (2011) Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis, pp. 666-675. , Springer; Burt, R., Santana, E., Principe, J.C., Thigpen, N., Keil, A., Predicting visual attention using gamma kernels (2016) 2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP).

Differently from many earlier systems with the same aim, the proposed system does not employ templates for the generation task. It assumes that there exist some natural language sentences in the application domain and uses this repository for the natural language description. It does not require, however, a large corpus as it is often required in machine learning approaches. The systems consist of two main components. The first one aims at analyzing the sentences and constructs a Grammatical Framework (GF) for given sentences and is implemented using the Stanford parser and an answer set program. The second component is for sentence construction and relies on GF Library. The paper includes two use cases to demostrate the capability of the system. As the sentence construction is done via GF, the paper includes a use case evaluation showing that the proposed system could also be utilized in addressing a challenge to create an abstract Wikipedia, which is recently discussed in the BlueSky session of the 2018 International Semantic Web Conference. © V.D.

However, those algorithms are most often optimized w.r.t. classification accuracy, but not the understandability of the resulting model. In this paper, we focus on a particular aspect of understandability, i.e., semantic coherence. We introduce a variant of a separate-and-conquer rule learning algorithm using a WordNet-based heuristic to learn rules that are semantically coherent. In an evaluation on different datasets, we show that the approach learns rules that are significantly more semantically coherent, without losing accuracy.

In this paper, we propose new question answering (QA) task and dataset for human-robot collaboration on task-oriented operation, i.e., task-oriented collaborative QA (TCQA). Differing from conventional video QA for answering questions about what happened in video clips constrained by scripts and subtitles, TC-QA aims to share common ground for task-oriented operation through question answering. We propose an open-end (OE) format of answer with text reply, image with annotated related objects, and video with operation duration to guide operation execution. Designed for grounding, the TC-QA dataset comprises query videos and questions to seek acknowledgement, correction, attention to task-related objects, and information on objects or operation. Due to the flexibility of real-world task with limited training sample, we propose and evaluate a baseline method based on a hybrid approach. The hybrid approach employs deep learning methods for object detection, hand detection and gesture recognition, and symbolic reasoning to ground question on observation for providing the answer. Our experiments show that the hybrid method is effective for the TC-QA task. © 2020 IEEE.",corpora; human-robot collaboration; hybrid system; multi-modal grounding; question answering,Deep learning; Learning systems; Object detection; Baseline methods; Collaborative application; Human-robot collaboration; Hybrid approach; Learning methods; Question Answering; Real-world task; Symbolic reasoning; Social robots,"Dillenbourg, P., Traum, D., Schneider, D., (1996) Grounding in Multi-modal Task-oriented Collaboration, , Oct; Tapaswi, M., Zhu, Y., Stiefelhagen, R., Torralba, A., Urtasun, R., Fidler, S., Movieqa: Understanding stories in movies through question-answering (2016) IEEE CVPR; Lei, J., Yu, L., Berg, T.L., Bansal, M., TVQA+: Spatio-temporal grounding for video question answering (2019) CoRR, , abs/1904. 11574; Yu, Z., Xu, D., Yu, J., Yu, T., Zhao, Z., Zhuang, Y., Tao, D., Activitynet-qa: A dataset for understanding complex web videos via question answering (2019) CoRR, , abs/1906. 02467; Wu, Q., Teney, D., Wang, P., Shen, C., Dick, A.R., Van Den Hengel, A., Visual question answering: A survey of methods and datasets (2016) CoRR, , abs/1607. 05910; Ren, M., Kiros, R., Zemel, R.S., Image question answering: A visual semantic embedding model and a new dataset (2015) CoRR, , abs/1505. 02074; Yu, L., Park, E., Berg, A.C., Berg, T.L., Visual madlibs: Fill in the blank image generation and question answering (2015) CoRR, , abs/1506. 00278; Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Bernstein, M.S., Fei-Fei, L., Visual7w: Grounded question answering in images (2015) CoRR, , abs/1511. 03416; Johnson, J., Hariharan, B., Van Der Maaten, L., Fei-Fei, L., Lawrence Zitnick, C., Girshick, R., Clevr: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning (2017) IEEE CVPR; Wang, P., Wu, Q., Shen, C., Dick, A., Van Den Hengel, A., Explicit knowledge-based reasoning for visual question answering (2017) Proceedings of the 26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1290-1296; Jang, Y., Song, Y., Yu, Y., Kim, Y., Kim, G., TGIF-qa: Toward spatio-temporal reasoning in visual question answering (2017) CoRR, , abs/1704. 04497; Xu, D., Zhao, Z., Xiao, J., Wu, F., Zhang, H., He, X., Zhuang, Y., Video question answering via gradually refined attention over appearance and motion (2017) Proceedings of the 25th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 1645-1653; Colas, A., Kim, S., Dernoncourt, F., Gupte, S., Zhe Wang, D., Soon Kim, D., (2019) Tutorialvqa: Question Answering Dataset for Tutorial Videos; Malinowski, M., Rohrbach, M., Fritz, M., Ask your neurons: A neural-based approach to answering questions about images (2015) CoRR, , abs/1505. 01121; Yang, Z., He, X., Gao, J., Deng, L., Smola, A.J., Stacked attention networks for image question answering (2015) CoRR, , abs/1511. 02274; Andreas, J., Rohrbach, M., Darrell, T., Klein, D., Deep compositional question answering with neural module networks (2015) CoRR, , abs/1511. 02799; Andreas, J., Rohrbach, M., Darrell, T., Klein, D., Learning to compose neural networks for question answering (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, , June; Xiong, C., Merity, S., Socher, R., Dynamic memory networks for visual and textual question answering (2016) Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on International Conference on Machine Learning; Gao, J., Ge, R., Chen, K., Nevatia, R., Motion-appearance co-memory networks for video question answering (2018) CoRR, , abs/1803. 10906; Zhao, Z., Jiang, X., Cai, D., Xiao, J., He, X., Pu, S., Multi-turn video question answering via multi-stream hierarchical attention context network Jul 2018, pp. 3690-3696; Ellebracht, L.D., Ramisa, A., Swaroop Madhyastha, P., Cordero-Rama, J., Moreno-Noguer, F., Quattoni, A., Semantic tuples for evaluation of image to sentence generation (2015) Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Vision and Language, pp. 18-28; Anderson, P., Fernando, B., Johnson, M., Gould, S., Spice: Semantic propositional image caption evaluation (2016) European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 382-398. , Springer",,The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Signal Processing Society,IEEE,"2020 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP 2020",25 September 2020 through 28 September 2020,,165772,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098645383

One of the major challenges that they face is knowledge entailment from the ongoing conversations with a user. Knowledge entailment implies entailing facts that indicate opinions, beliefs, expressions, requests, and feelings of a particular user about a particular target during conversations. The entailed pieces of knowledge will evolve the background knowledge graph of cognitive technologies and advance their contextual inference and reasoning capabilities. Although the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community deals with the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) task, it is treated in a static manner where the predefined hypothesis is typically fed to the learning model, and then the model decides whether it is an entailment or not. However, since the discourse of conversations is dynamic and unpredictable, the traditional RTE approach does not suffice in the context of conversational agents. In this vision paper, we demonstrate our work in progress as to inject background knowledge into machine learning approaches where it entails facts using domain-specific ontologies and contextualized knowledge. Further, we propose investigating solutions for extending or transferring this approach to other domains. We frame our discussion in a case study related to mental health conversations.

By “understand” we mean that the system can take natural language text as input and answer questions with respect to that text. A key component in building such systems is to be able to translate natural language text into appropriate knowledge representation (KR) languages. Our approach to achieve that is inspired by Montagues path breaking thesis (1970) of viewing English as a formal language and by the research in natural language semantics. Our approach is based on PCCG (Probabilistic Combinatorial Categorial Grammars), λ-calculus and statistical learning of parameters. In an initial work, we start with an initial vocabulary consisting of λ-calculus representations of a small set of words and a training corpus of sentences and their representation in a KR language. We develop a learning based system that learns the λ-calculus representation of words from this corpus and generalizes it to words of the same category. The key and novel aspect in this learning is the development of Inverse Lambda algorithms which when given λ-expressions β and γ can come up with an α such that application of α to β (or β to α) will give us γ. We augment this with learning of weights associated with multiple meanings of words. Our current system produces improved results on standard corpora on natural language interfaces for robot command and control and database queries. In a follow-up work we are able to use patterns to make guesses regarding the initial vocabulary. This together with learning of parameters allow us to develop a fully automated (without any initial vocabulary) way to translate English to designated KR languages. In an on-going work we use Answer Set Programming as the target KR language and focus on (a) solving combinatorial puzzles that are described in English and (b) answering questions with respect to a chapter in a ninth grade biology book. The systems that we are building are good examples of integration of results from multiple sub-fields of AI and computer science, viz.: machine learning, knowledge representation, natural language processing, λ-calculus (functional programming) and ontologies. In this presentation we will describe our approach and our system and elaborate on some of the lessons that we have learned from this effort. © 2011, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Calculations; Command and control systems; Computational mechanics; Computer circuits; Computer programming; Computer systems programming; Differentiation (calculus); Formal languages; Functional programming; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linguistics; Logic programming; Query languages; Semantics; Syntactics; Translation (languages); Answer set programming; Categorial grammar; Combinatorial puzzles; Knowledge representation language; Natural language interfaces; Natural language semantics; Natural language text; Statistical learning; Natural language processing systems,,"Baral, C.; Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, United States; email: chitta@asu.edu",,Springer Verlag,"11th International Conference on Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning, LPNMR 2011",16 May 2011 through 19 May 2011,,205169,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037530004

ANN has made a dramatic improvement in the versatile area of Machine Learning (ML). ANN is a gathering of vast number of weighted interconnected artificial neurons, initially invented with the inspiration of biological neurons. These models are much better than previous models implemented with Symbolic AI so far as their performance is concerned. One revolutionary change in ANN is Convolution Neural Network (CNN). These structures are mainly suitable for complex pattern recognition tasks within images. Here we would discuss basics of ANN as a tool for complex pattern recognition and image processing task. Also some applications of the CNN tool we will present OCR based text translation and biometric based uni modal and multimodal person identification systems. © 2020 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Network; Computer Vision; Convolution Neural Network; Machine Intelligence; Machine Learning; Neural Network AI; Pattern Recognition; Symbolic AI,Complex networks; Convolution; Image processing; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Artificial neurons; Biological neuron; Convolution neural network; Multi-modal; Revolutionary changes; Neural networks,"Ciresan, D.C., Meier, U., Gambardella, L.M., Schmidhuber, H., Convolutional neural network committees for handwritten character classification (2011) Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2011 International Conference On, IEEE, pp. 1135-1139; Farabet, C., Martini, B., Akselrod, P., Talay, S., LeCun, Y., Culurciello, E., Hardware accelerated convolutional neural networks for synthetic vision systems (2010) Circuits and Systems (ISCAS).

The crucial task to achieve this is to automatically classify sentences in legal documents into categories based on their content. In this paper, a deep learning model is proposed that breaks down legal documents and classifies the rhetorical types of sentences. A hypothesis is tested, that using a small set of labelled data, deeper and more accurate models for the processing of legal documents can be constructed. This will automate the processing of legal documents hence decreasing, and ultimately eliminating the backlog that currently exists throughout various legal systems. This work can be generalized for legal appeals cases in diverse fields. The various configurations used to train the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model will be compared along with a variety of embeddings. The experiments obtained their highest accuracy using the Bi-LSTM model with 300-dimensional GloVe embeddings compared to the previous techniques used for the semantic understanding of law related documents. © 2020 IEEE.",Bi LSTMs; Classification; Embeddings; Rhetorical role,Authentication; Embeddings; Information retrieval systems; Laws and legislation; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Clearance rates; Diverse fields; Learning models; Legal documents; Legal system; NAtural language processing; Semantic understanding; Deep learning,"(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 5th ed., American Psychiatric Association; (2012) Department of Veterans Affairs.

In almost all sub-fields, artificial neural networks have reached or exceeded human-level performance. However, most of the models are not interpretable. As a result, it is hard to trust their decisions, especially in life and death scenarios. In recent years, there has been a movement toward creating explainable artificial intelligence, but most work to date has concentrated on image processing models, as it is easier for humans to perceive visual patterns. There has been little work in other fields like natural language processing. In this paper, we train a convolutional model on textual data and analyze the global logic of the model by studying its filter values. In the end, we find the most important words in our corpus to our model's logic and remove the rest (95%). New models trained on just the 5% most important words can achieve the same performance as the original model while reducing training time by more than half. Approaches such as this will help us to understand NLP models, explain their decisions according to their word choices, and improve them by finding blind spots and biases. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Such applications inherently involve huge volume of data, and feeding them as inputs to advanced machine-learning tools ever remains elusive. While the representation of the underlying graph has to be compact, it must also capture aptly the structural diversity of different graphs/networks so that the learning engines can be suitably trained. We observe that two factors are responsible for making this gulf wider. First, a large graph representing real data is memory-strenuous, and may have non-Euclidean attributes; secondly, most of the deep-learning tools perform better on low-dimensional, Euclidean or structured data such as text or graphic images. In this work, we propose a linear encoding of graphs based on Prufer-sequence that provides an efficient mechanism to preserve their structural information. Experimental results on directed acyclic graphs representing digital integrated-circuit netlists, establish the efficacy of such encoding. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Digital circuits; Large-graph encoding; Machine learning,Deep learning; Digital circuits; Digital integrated circuits; Encoding (symbols); Graphic methods; Learning systems; Network coding; Communication infrastructure; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Large graphs; Low dimensional; Structural diversity; Structural information; Structured data; Underlying graphs; Directed graphs,"Bengio, Y., Learning deep architectures for AI (2009) Foundations and Trendső in Machine Learning, 2 (1), pp. 1-127. , 2009; Biedl, T., Brandenburg, F.J., Partitions of graphs into trees (2007) Proc.

In this paper we propose a representation framework of stochastic AOGs that is agnostic to the type of the data being modeled and thus unifies various domain-specific AOGs. Many existing grammar formalisms and probabilistic models in natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning can be seen as special cases of this framework. We also propose a domain-independent inference algorithm of stochastic context-free AOGs and show its tractability under a reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we provide two interpretations of stochastic context-free AOGs as a subset of probabilistic logic, which connects stochastic AOGs to the field of statistical relational learning and clarifies their relation with a few existing statistical relational models.",,Artificial intelligence; Computer circuits; Computer vision; Inference engines; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Probabilistic logics; Stochastic models; Domain independents; Grammar formalisms; Inference algorithm; NAtural language processing; Probabilistic models; Statistical relational learning; Stochastic grammars; Unified framework; Stochastic systems,"Bach, F.R., Jordan, M.I., Thin junction trees (2001) NIPS; Jin Choi, M., Tan, F.V.Y., Anandkumar, A., Willsky, A.S., Learning latent tree graphical models (2011) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 12, pp. 1771-1812; Cussens, J., Parameter estimation in stochastic logic programs (2001) Machine Learning, 44 (3), pp. 245-271; Darwiche, A., A differential approach to inference in Bayesian networks (2003) Journal of the ACM (JACM), 50 (3), pp. 280-305; Dechter, R., Mateescu, R., And/or search spaces for graphical models (2007) Artificial Intelligence, 171 (2), pp. 73-106; Domingos, P., Austin Webb, W., A tractable first-order probabilistic logic (2012) AAAI; Felzenszwalb, P., McAllester, D., Ramanan, D., A discriminatively trained, multiscale, deformable part model (2008) CVPR; Fire, A., Zhu, S.C., Using causal induction in humans to learn and infer causality from video (2013) 35th Annual Cognitive Science Conference (CogSci); Sun Fu, K., (1982) Syntactic Pattern Recognition and Applications, 4. , Prentice-Hall Englewood Cliffs; Getoor, L., Taskar, B., (2007) Introduction to Statistical Relational Learning, , MIT press; Ivanov, Y.A., Bobick, A.F., Recognition of visual activities and interactions by stochastic parsing (2000) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 22 (8), pp. 852-872; Jin, Y., Geman, S., Context and hierarchy in a probabilistic image model (2006) CVPR; Johnson, M., Parsing with discontinuous constituents (1985) ACL; Lange, M., Leiß, H., To CNF or not to CNF an efficient yet presentable version of the CYK algorithm (2009) Informatica Didactica, 8, pp. 2008-2010; Manning, C.D., Schütze, H., (1999) Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, USA; Meila, M., Jordan, M.I., Learning with mixtures of trees (2001) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 1, pp. 1-48; Muggleton, S., Stochastic logic programs (1996) Advances in Inductive Logic Programming, 32, pp. 254-264; Pei, M., Jia, Y., Zhu, S.-C., Parsing video events with goal inference and intent prediction (2011) ICCV; Pollard, C., Sag, I.A., Information-based syntax and semantics: Vol 1: Fundamentals (1988) Center for the Study of Language and Information, , Stanford, CA, USA; Pollard, C., (1984) Generalized Context-free Grammars, Head Grammars and Natural Language, , Ph.

Deep neural networks have reached extremely high accuracy levels in many fields. However, they still encounter many challenges. In particular, the models are not explainable or easy to trust, especially in life and death scenarios. They may reach correct predictions through inappropriate reasoning and have biases or other limitations. In addition, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. An attacker can subtly manipulate data and affect a model’s prediction. In this paper, we demonstrate a brand new adversarial attack method in textual data. We use activation maximization to create an importance rating for each unique word in the corpus and attack the most important words in each sentence. The rating is global to the whole corpus and not to each specific data point. This method performs equal or better when compared to previous attack methods, and its running time is around 39 times faster than previous models. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Adversarial attacks; CNN; Deep learning; LSTM; Natural language processing; Transformers,Deep neural networks; Long short-term memory; Accuracy level; Adversarial attack; Attack methods; CNN; Deep learning; High-accuracy; Life and death; LSTM; Machine-vision; Transformer; Natural language processing systems,"Akhtar, N., Mian, A., Threat of adversarial attacks on deep learning in computer vision: A survey (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 14410-14430; Brendel, W., Rauber, J., Bethge, M., (2017) Decision-Based Adversarial Attacks: Reliable Attacks against Black-Box Machine Learning Models.

Such representations are known to improve the performance of downstream learning tasks (e.g. classification) or applications such as contextual search and analogical reasoning. We apply word embedding techniques from natural language processing (NLP) to train embeddings for library packages ('library vectors'). Library vectors represent libraries by similar context of use as determined by import statements present in source code. Experimental results obtained from training such embeddings on three large open source software corpora reveals that library vectors capture semantically meaningful relationships among software libraries, such as the relationship between frameworks and their plug-ins and libraries commonly used together within ecosystems such as big data infrastructure projects (in Java), front-end and back-end web development frameworks (in JavaScript) and data science toolkits (in Python). © 2019 IEEE.",Information retrieval; Machine learning; Software engineering,Embeddings; High level languages; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Open systems; Search engines; Semantics; Software engineering; Analogical reasoning; Data infrastructure; Embedding technique; NAtural language processing; OR applications; Semantic similarity; Software libraries; Web development frameworks; Open source software,"Deshpande, A., Riehle, D., The total growth of open source (2008) Open Source Development, Communities and Quality, Ser.

The core component of a model in the IDP framework is an FO(·) theory consisting of formulas in first order logic and definitions; the latter are basically logic programs where clause bodies can have arbitrary first order formulas. Hence, it is a small step for a well-versed computer scientist to start modeling. We describe some models resulting from the collaboration between IDP experts and domain experts solving machine learning and data mining tasks. A first task is in the domain of stemmatology, a domain of philology concerned with the relationship between surviving variant versions of text. A second task is about a somewhat similar problem within biology where phylogenetic trees are used to represent the evolution of species. A third and final task is about learning a minimal automaton consistent with a given set of strings.

Furthermore, speech and vision are the primary modalities by which humans collect information about the world, but the linking of visual and natural language domains is a relatively new pursuit in computer vision, and it is difficult to test performance in a safe environment. To couple human visual understanding and machine perception, we present an explanatory system for creating a library of possible context-specific actions associated with 3D objects in immersive virtual worlds. We also contribute a novel scene description dataset, generated natively in virtual reality containing speech, image, gaze, and acceleration data. We discuss the development of a hybrid machine learning algorithm linking vision data with environmental affordances in natural language. Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to develop a model which can generate interpretable verbal descriptions of possible actions associated with recognized 3D objects within immersive VR environments. © 2018 Authors.",commonsense reasoning; explainable ai; explainable robotic systems; virtual reality,Digital libraries; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Man machine systems; Virtual reality; Visual languages; Acceleration data; Commonsense reasoning; Hybrid machine learning; Machine perception; Natural languages; Primary modality; Robotic systems; Scene description; Human robot interaction,"Blass, J.A., Forbus, K.D., Analogical chaining with natural language instruction for commonsense reasoning (2017) AAAI, pp. 4357-4363; Fahlman, S.E., (1979) NETL, A System for Representing and Using Real-world Knowledge, , MIT press; Molineaux, M., Aha, D.W., (2015) Continuous Explanation Generation in A Multi-agent Domain, , Technical Report.

Patent information is, however, not employed to its full potential and the interpretation of structured and unstructured patent information in large volumes remains a challenge. We address this by proposing an integrated interdisciplinary approach that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to formalize multilingual patent information in an ontology. The ontology further contains patent and domain specific knowledge, which allows for aligning patents with technological fields of interest and other business-related artifacts. Our empirical evaluation shows that for categorizing patents according to well-known technological fields of interest, the approach achieves high accuracy with selected feature sets compared to related work focussing on monolingual patents. We further show that combining OWL RL reasoning with SPARQL querying over the patent knowledge base allows for answering complex business queries and illustrate this with real-world use cases from the automotive domain. © 2016 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Automotive domains; Domain-specific knowledge; Empirical evaluations; Intellectual capital; Knowledge base; Machine learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Patent information; Patents and inventions,"Ulmschneider, K., Michelberger, B., Glimm, B., Mutschler, B., Reichert, M., On maintaining semantic networks: Challenges, algorithms, use cases (2015) Int.

Since ML techniques depend on numerical input representations, word embeddings are increasingly utilized to convert symbolic representations such as text into meaningful numbers. However, a naïve one-to-one mapping of each word in a database to a word embedding vector is not sufficient since it would miss to incorporate rich context information given by the database schema, e.g. which words appear in the same column or are related to each other. Additionally, many text values in databases are very specific and would not have any counterpart within the word embedding. In this paper, we therefore, propose Retro (RElational reTROfitting), a novel approach to learn numerical representations of text values in databases, capturing the information encoded by general-purpose word embeddings and the database-specific information encoded by the tabular relations. We formulate relation retrofitting as a learning problem and present an efficient algorithm solving it. We investigate the impact of various hyperparameters on the learning problem. Our evaluation shows that embedding generated for database text values using Retro are ready-to-use for many ML tasks and even outperform state-of-the-art techniques. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

"Chen T.-P., Su L.",57207993823;55966919100;,Harmony transformer: Incorporating chord segmentation into harmony recognition,2019,"Proceedings of the 20th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, ISMIR 2019",,,,259,267,,7,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087097185&partnerID=40&md5=81ac54128b45e5f80afcf86ffdabfe77,"Musical harmony analysis is usually a process of unfolding and interpreting the hierarchical structure of music. Computational approaches to such structural analysis are still challenging, owing to the fact that the boundary between different harmonic states (such as chord functions) is not explicitly defined in the audio or symbolic music data. It is a novel approach to improve chord recognition by jointly identifying chord change using end-to-end sequence learning. In this paper, we propose the Harmony Transformer, a multi-task music harmony analysis model aiming to improve chord recognition through incorporating chord segmentation into the recognition process. The integration of chord segmentation and chord recognition is implemented with the Transformer, a deep sequential learning model yielding fruitful results in the field of natural language processing. A non-autoregressive decoding framework is also adopted here in aid of concatenating the two highly correlated tasks. Experiments of both chord symbol recognition and functional harmony recognition on audio and symbolic datasets demonstrate that explicitly learning the hierarchical structural information of musical data can facilitate and improve the harmony recognition. © 2020 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.

Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) received a special interest among other methods of providing explanations for model decisions due to the fact that it can easily be paired with a black box and then can propose a post-hoc explanation framework. In this paper, we propose a CBR-Based method to not only explain a model decision but also provide recommendations to the user in an easily understandable visual interface.

However, anti-bullying programs should not focus on labeling children as either bullies or victims since they could produce opposite effects. Thus, an approach to deal with bullying episodes, without labeling children, is to determine their severity, so that school staff may respond to them appropriately. Related work about computational techniques to fight against bullying showed promising results but they offer categorical information as a set of labels. This work proposes a framework to determine bullying severity in texts, composed by two parts: (1) evaluation of texts using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers found in the literature, and (2) development of a Fuzzy Logic System that uses the outputs of SVM classifiers as its inputs to identify the bullying severity. Results show that it is necessary to improve the accuracy of SVM classifiers to determine the bullying severity through Fuzzy Logic. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Bullying; Fuzzy logic; Machine learning; Text mining,Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Data mining; Education; Learning systems; Soft computing; Support vector machines; Bullying; Computational technique; Fuzzy logic system; On-machines; Related works; SVM classifiers; Text mining; Fuzzy logic,"Tusinski, K., (2008) The Causes and Consequences of Bullying; Bauer, N.S., Lozano, P., Rivara, F.P., The effectiveness of the olweus bullying prevention program in public middle schools: A controlled trial (2007) J.

A sentence-level sentiment analysis using machine learning method and fuzzy logic is used for the work. Using ART classifier, the dataset is trained and monograms in the dataset are divided into eight classes and assigned a score. When the system accepts the input text, monograms in the text are used to find the domain of the text. After identifying the domain by comparing the trained data, the system assigns the scores to the sentences based on the scores of the pre-trained data. The overall score is calculated by adding up the individual scores and identifies whether the text is having positive or negative sentiments. By using fuzzy logic, the polarity of the input is calculated. Since there is no standardized dataset in Malayalam for sentiment analysis, the training data is collected from the Malayalam online newspaper. In short, system identifies the domain of the input text and then finds the sentiment and its polarity. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Association rule tree; Fuzzy logic; Sentiment analysis,Arts computing; Classification (of information); Computer circuits; Intelligent computing; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Domain independents; Individual scores; Machine learning methods; Malayalams; Negative sentiments; Online newspaper; Sentence level; Training data; Fuzzy logic,"Anagha, M., Fuzzy logic based hybrid approach for sentiment analysis of Malayalam movie reviews (2015) IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Informatics, Communication and Energy Systems (SPICES); Mukherjee, S., Bhattacharya, P., Sentiment Analysis: A Literature Survey.

We introduce a representation which reduces polyphonic music to a univariate categorical sequence. In this way, we are able to apply state of the art natural language processing techniques, namely the long short-term memory sequence model. The representation we employ permits arbitrary rhythmic structure, which we assume to be given. We show that our model is effective on four out of four piano roll based benchmark datasets. We further improve our model by augmenting our training data set with transpositions of the original pieces through all musical keys, thereby convincingly advancing the state of the art on these benchmark problems. We also fit models to music which is unconstrained in its rhythmic structure, discuss the properties of the model, and provide musical samples. We also describe and provide with full (non piano roll) timing information our new carefully preprocessed dataset of 19700 classical midi music files - significantly more than previously available. © 2016 C.

We can therefore only make limited use of formal knowledge organization methods to support researchers and other interested parties with features such as automatic aggregations, fact checking, consistency checking, question answering, and powerful semantic search. Existing approaches to solve this problem by improving the scientific communication methods have either very restricted coverage, require formal logic skills on the side of the researchers, or depend on unreliable machine learning for the formalization of knowledge. Here, I propose an approach to this problem that is general, intuitive, and flexible. It is based on a unique kind of controlled natural language, called AIDA, consisting of English sentences that are atomic, independent, declarative, and absolute. Such sentences can then serve as nodes in a network of scientific claims linked to publications, researchers, and domain elements. I present here some small studies on preliminary applications of this language. The results indicate that it is well accepted by users and provides a good basis for the creation of a knowledge graph of scientific findings. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.",,Formal logic; Learning systems; Semantics; Automatic aggregations; Consistency checking; Controlled natural language; Natural languages; Question Answering; Scientific communication; Scientific findings; Unreliable machine; Natural language processing systems,"Bastian, H., Glasziou, P., Chalmers, I., Seventy-five trials and eleven systematic reviews a day: How will we ever keep up?

The news websites are publishing the news and provide the source of authentication. The question is how to authenticate the news and articles which are circulated among social media like WhatsApp groups, Facebook Pages, Twitter and other micro blogs & social networking sites. It is harmful for the society to believe on the rumors and pretend to be a news. The need of an hour is to stop the rumors especially in the developing countries like India, and focus on the correct, authenticated news articles. This paper demonstrates a model and the methodology for fake news detection. With the help of Machine learning and natural language processing, author tried to aggregate the news and later determine whether the news is real or fake using Support Vector Machine. The results of the proposed model is compared with existing models.

We study and compare algorithms that have been proposed as models for human orthographic and morphological processing, such as the two layers symbolic network (AKA Naive Discriminatory Learning network) proposed by Baayen et al [1], and the dual-route approach presented by Grainger and Ziegler [2]. In addition, we study the effect of representing letters as one-hot vectors or via distributed vector representations, much like the natural language processing field has done for words. Experiment results show a better performance for the dual-route algorithm using distributed letter representations, both in terms of accuracy and speed. Our results are obtained with training sets in the tens of thousands of words, as opposed to the hundreds of thousands of words used elsewhere in the literature. These results point to the feasibility of taking advantage of morpho-orthographic patterns in order to assist with word processing in natural language processing tasks. © 2018 IEEE.",,Natural language processing systems; Network layers; Semantic Web; Semantics; Word processing; Dual route; Learning network; Learning neural networks; Morphological processing; Training sets; Vector representations; Deep neural networks,"Harald, B.R., Milin, P., Filipovic Durdevic, D., Hendrix, P., Marelli, M., An amorphous model for morphological processing in visual comprehension based on naive discriminative learning (2011) Psychological Review; Grainger, J., Ziegler, J., A dual-route approach to orthographic processing (2011) Frontiers in Psychology, 2; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 25; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G., Dean, J., Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 26 (NIPS 2013); Zhang, Y., Wallace, B., A sensitivity analysis of (and practitioners' guide to) convolutional neural networks for sentence classification (2017) Proceedings of the 8th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing.; Mnih, A., Kavukcuoglu, K., Learning word embeddings efficiently with noise-contrastive estimation (2013) Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS); Mikolov, T., Chen, K., Corrado, G., Dean, J., (2013) Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space International Conference on Learning Representation; Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G.S., Zheng, X., (2015) TensorFlow: Large-scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems, , Software available from tensorflow.

Its impact on various computer-related domains and recent breakthroughs in neural computation has increased the opportunities for better solutions to be developed. This research takes the research efforts a step further by designing and developing a novel neurofuzzy approach for semantic textual similarity that uses neural networks and fuzzy logics. The fundamental notion is to combine the remarkable capabilities of the current neural models for working with text with the possibilities that fuzzy logic provides for aggregating numerical information in a tailored manner. The results of our experiments suggest that this approach is capable of accurately determining semantic textual similarity. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Data integration; Deep learning applications; Neurofuzzy; Semantic similarity,Deep learning; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Semantics; Deep learning application; Fuzzy-Logic; Neural computations; Neural fuzzy; Neuro-Fuzzy; Neuro-fuzzy approach; Research efforts; Semantic similarity; Semantic similarity measurement; Textual similarities; Data integration,"Angelov, P.P., Buswell, R.A., Automatic generation of fuzzy rule-based models from data by genetic algorithms (2003) Inf.

Although these methods have achieved different levels of performance, all of them are still unable to represent all types of building-code requirements. There is, thus, a need to enhance the semantic representations of building codes towards facilitating the representation of all requirements. To address this need, this paper first proposes a new approach to annotate and represent building-code sentences using requirement units that consist of semantic information elements and simple logic operators. To evaluate the proposed building-code annotation approach, this paper also proposes a new natural language generation (NLG)-based method for evaluating annotation quality. The proposed method consists of four steps: data preparation, data preprocessing, NLG model development and training, and sentence evaluation. Sentences from the International Code Council (ICC) building codes were used in the evaluation. © EG-ICE 2020 Workshop on Intelligent Computing in Engineering, Proceedings.

Conversational bots are modern chat messengers where the computer is trained to learn and respond to human queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for various languages and advanced machine learning algorithms. We propose an architecture that integrates various services using conversational bots into the travel workflow that consists of search, booking, travel documents processing like visa, immigration, checking in, onboarding and helping to provide destination services like cab booking, hotels, and events. Workflow typically maintains state, context, performers, and tasks. Conversational bots can easily integrate the input and output to such workflows through an orchestration layer that manages the business logic, context variables and enable activities for both human and conversation bot to complete a goal or task. We also built a prototype using IBM Watson platform to provide an illustration of the architecture services. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.",Architecture; Bots; Machine learning; NLP; Travel,Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Telecommunication services; Bots; Business logic; Context variables; Input and outputs; Travel; Travel documents; Travel experiences; Workflow services; Botnet,"http://www.amadeus.com/blog/22/04/chat-bots-impact-travel-industry/; http://blog.directpay.online/travel-businesses-benefit-chatbots; https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/; https://www.jbpm.org/; Storey, M.-A., Zagalsky, A., Disrupting developer productivity one bot at a time (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 24Th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Foundations of Software Engineering, , ACM; Boden, C., Fischer, J., Herbig, K., Spierling, U., CitizenTalk: Application of chatbot infotainment to e-democracy (2006) TIDSE 2006.

Prior work has been plagued by small traces, limited either by the overheads of dynamic profiling, statically available information [4], or side-exit branches [5]. In this work, we rethink what code path sequences to fuse and construct long traces for offloading to spatial accelerators, while minimizing the occurrence of side exits which limit dynamic coverage. We introduce a novel technique that recasts learning a program's execution patterns as a natural-language-processing problem, CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words). We then use a deep learning network to learn the relationships among paths. During the compilation phase, the compiler uses a sequence miner to decide what paths are likely to occur. The learning network predicts a Deepframe online, which is an extended basic block comprising a multi-path sequence (each path itself is composed of multiple basic blocks). We demonstrate the efficacy of Deepframe on spatial hardware accelerators and find the following: i) Deepframe can construct up to 5x (max: 27x) longer offload regions compared to prior approaches. ii) Surprisingly far-flung ILP (instruction-level parallelism) and MLP (memory-level parallelism) can be mined from the frames statically (5.5x increase in ILP and 10.5x increase in MLP). iii) The frames offloaded to the spatial accelerator have minimal side exits (mis-speculation) and achieve sufficient dynamic coverage to improve overall application performance (up to 9x improvement).

We show how to incorporate position into a fully distributed vector formed from Vector Quantization, or add position to a vector formed from a Vector Symbolic Architecture. The method guarantees that small shifts in position result in small changes to the representation vector, and does not require an increase in vector size. The incorporation of positional binding improves performance on CIFAR-10 and on a new database of noisy abstract face images, which we hereby make public. For Deep Learning approaches, we emphasize the importance of positional binding, and this sheds light on why multiple layers and pooling are beneficial. © 2016 IEEE.",binding; distributed representation; image representation; representation; vector symbolic archichetecture,Abstracting; Bins; binding; Deep learning; Distributed representation; Face images; Image representations; Multiple layers; representation; Vectors,"Coates, A., Ng, A.Y., The importance of encoding versus training with sparse coding and vector quantization (2011) ICML, 28; Coates, A., Lee, H., Ng, A.Y., An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning (2011) AISTATS, 14; Kanerva, P., (1988) Sparse Distributed Memory, , Cambridge, MA MIT Press; Kanerva, P., Fully distributed representation (1997) Proc. i 997 RealWorld Computing Symposium (Report TR-96001), pp. 358-365. , Tsukuba-City, Japan; Plate, T.A., Holographic recurrent networks (1992) Advances in Neural Itiformation Processing Systems, , C L.

Traditionally, these learning algorithms are implemented in clusters of CPUs and GPUs. But with the increase in data size, the models created on CPUs and GPUs are not scalable. Hence we need a hardware model which can be scaled beyond current data and model sizes. This is where FPGA comes into place. With the advancement of CAD tools for FPGAs, the designers do not need to create the architectures of the networks in RTL level using HDLs like Verilog and VHDL. They can use High-level Language like C or C++ to build the models using tools like Xilinx Vivado HLS. Also, the power consumption of FPGA based models for deep learning is substantially low as compared to GPUs. In this paper, we have done an extensive survey of various implementations of FPGA based deep learning architectures with emphasis on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The CNN architectures presented in the literature consume large memory for the storage of weights and images. It is not possible to store this information in the internal FPGA Block RAM. This paper presents comprehensive servery of the methods and techniques used in literatures to tackle the memory consumption issue and how the data movement between high storage external DDR memory and internal BRAM can be reduced. © 2018 IEEE.",Convolutional neural netwrok; FPGA.,C++ (programming language); Computer aided design; Computer aided logic design; Convolution; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Memory architecture; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Program processors; Random access storage; Speech recognition; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural netwrok; Data movements; Hardware models; Learning architectures; Memory consumption; Memory optimization; NAtural language processing; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA),"Li, H., Fan, X., Jiao, L., Cao, W., Zhou, X., Wang, L., A high performance FPGA-based accelerator for large-scale convolutional neural networks (2016) 2016 26th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL), pp. 1-9. , Aug; Liu, Z., Dou, Y., Jiang, J., Xu, J., Automatic code generation of convolutional neural networks in FPGA implementation (2016) 2016 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology (FPT), pp. 61-68. , Dec; Wang, J., Lin, J., Wang, Z., Efficient hardware architectures for deep convolutional neural network (2018) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, 65 (6). , June; Qiu, J., Wang, J., Yao, S., Guo, K., Li, B., Zhou, E., Yu, J., Yang, H., Going deeper with embedded FPGA platform for convolutional neural network (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays, Ser.

The aim of knowledge-aware and conversational recommender systems is to go beyond the traditional accuracy goal and to start a new generation of algorithms and interactive approaches which exploit the knowledge encoded in ontological and logic-based knowledge bases, knowledge graphs as well as the semantics emerging from the analysis and exploitation of semi-structured textual sources. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Conversational agents; Knowledge base; Knowledge graph; Knowledge-aware; Linked data; Natural language processing,Knowledge based systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linked data; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Conversational agents; Conversational recommender systems; Interactive approach; Knowledge base; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge-aware; Machine learning techniques; Recommendation algorithms; Recommender systems,"Burke, R., Knowledge-based recommender systems (2000) Encyclopedia of Library and Information Systems, 6; Colucci, S., Noia, T.D., Sciascio, E.D., Donini, F.M., Ragone, A.-Z., Rizzi, R., A Semantic-based Fully Visual Application for Matchmaking and Query Refinement in B2C e-Marketplaces (2006) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Electronic Commerce: The New E-Commerce: Innovations for Conquering Current Barriers, Obstacles and Limitations to Conducting Successful Business on The Internet (ICEC'06), pp. 174-184. , ACM; De Gemmis, M., Lops, P., Musto, C., Narducci, F., Semeraro, G., Semantics-aware content-based recommender systems (2015) Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 119-159. , Springer; Noia, T.D., Magarelli, C., Maurino, A., Palmonari, M., Rula, A., Using ontology-based data summarization to develop semantics-aware recommender systems (2018) The Semantic Web - 15th International Conference, ESWC 2018, pp. 128-144. , Heraklion, Crete, Greece, June 3-7, 2018, Proceedings.

It builds on the AI2 Reasoning Challenge 2018 (ARC-18) which was organized as an advanced question answering task on a dataset of elementary science questions. The ARC- 18 questions were shown to be hard to answer with systems focusing on surface-level cues alone, instead requiring far more powerful knowledge and reasoning. To address MIER-19, we adopt a hybrid pipelined architecture comprising a featurerich learning-to-rank (LTR) machine learning model, followed by a rule-based system for reranking the LTR model predictions. Our system was ranked fourth in the official evaluation, scoring close to the second and third ranked teams, achieving 39.4% MAP. © 2019 EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 - Graph-Based Methods for Natural Language Processing - Proceedings of the 13th Workshop.

But how do we equip machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? Here, we show that applying machine learning to human texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about ""right"" and ""wrong"" conduct. We create a template list of prompts and responses, which include questions, such as “Should I kill people?”, “Should I murder people?”, etc. with answer templates of “Yes/no, I should (not).” The model's bias score is now the difference between the model's score of the positive response (“Yes, I should”) and that of the negative response (“No, I should not”). For a given choice overall, the model's bias score is the sum of the bias scores for all question/answer templates with that choice. We ran different choices through this analysis using a Universal Sentence Encoder. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our social, ethical and even moral choices. Our method holds promise for extracting, quantifying and comparing sources of moral choices in culture, including technology. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Bias in machine learning; Fairness in machine learning; Moral bias; Text-emedding models,Machine learning; Semantics; Human like; Moral bias; Text corpora; Philosophical aspects,"Bolukbasi, T., Chang, K.-W., Zou, J.Y., Saligrama, V., Kalai, A.T., Man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker?

For such tasks, one successful approach is to condition image-based convolutional network computation on language via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers, i.e., per-channel scaling and shifting. We propose to generate the parameters of FiLM layers going up the hierarchy of a convolutional network in a multi-hop fashion rather than all at once, as in prior work. By alternating between attending to the language input and generating FiLM layer parameters, this approach is better able to scale to settings with longer input sequences such as dialogue. We demonstrate that multi-hop FiLM generation significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art on the GuessWhat?! visual dialogue task and matches state-of-the art on the ReferIt object retrieval task, and we provide additional qualitative analysis. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Computer vision; Deep learning; Multi-modal learning; Natural language,Computer vision; Convolution; Deep learning; Modulation; Natural language processing systems; Convolutional networks; Linear modulations; Multi-modal learning; Natural languages; Object retrieval; Qualitative analysis; Question Answering; State of the art; Visual languages,"Antol, S., VQA: Visual question answering (2015) Proceedings of ICCV; Ba, J.L., Kiros, J.R., Hinton, G.E., Layer normalization (2016) Deep Learning Symposium (NIPS; Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate (2015) Proceedings of ICLR; Chung, J., Gulcehre, C., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., Empirical evaluation of gated recurrent neural networks on sequence modeling (2015) Proceedings of ICML; Das, A., (2017) Proceedings of CVPR, , Visual dialog.

With the development of deep learning techniques, current mainstream text-based CAPTCHAs have been proven to be insecure. Therefore, a major effort has been directed toward developing image-based CAPTCHAs, and image-based visual reasoning is emerging as a new direction of such development. Recently, Tencent deployed the Visual Turing Test (VTT) CAPTCHA. This appears to have been the first application of a visual reasoning scheme. Subsequently, other CAPTCHA service providers (Geetest, NetEase, Dingxiang, etc.) have proposed their own visual reasoning schemes to defend against bots. It is, therefore, natural to ask a fundamental question: are visual reasoning CAPTCHAs as secure as their designers expect? This paper presents the first attempt to solve visual reasoning CAPTCHAs. We implemented a holistic attack and a modular attack, which achieved overall success rates of 67.3% and 88.0% on VTT CAPTCHA, respectively. The results show that visual reasoning CAPTCHAs are not as secure as anticipated; this latest effort to use novel, hard AI problems for CAPTCHAs has not yet succeeded. Based on the lessons we learned from our attacks, we also offer some guidelines for designing visual CAPTCHAs with better security. © 2021 by The USENIX Association.

Since ML techniques depend on numerical input representations, word embeddings are increasingly utilized to convert symbolic representations such as text into meaningful numbers. However, those models do not incorporate the context-specific semantics of text values in the database. To significantly improve the representation of text values occurring in DBMS, we propose a novel retrofitting approach called Retro which considers both, the semantics of the word embedding and the relational schema. Based on this, we developed RetroLive, an interactive system, that allows exploring how the retrofitted embeddings improve the performance for various ML and integration tasks. Moreover, the demo includes several interactive visualizations to explore the characteristics of the adapted vectors and their connection to the relational database. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,Embeddings; Semantics; Visualization; Interactive system; Interactive visualizations; Numerical inputs; Relational Database; Relational schemas; Specific semantics; Symbolic representation; Relational database systems,"Alghunaim, A., Mohtarami, M., Cyphers, S., Glass, J., A vector space approach for aspect based sentiment analysis (2015) Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Vector Space Modeling for Natural Language Processing, pp. 116-122; Bojanowski, P., Grave, E., Joulin, A., Mikolov, T., Enriching word vectors with subword information (2017) Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, pp. 135-146. , 2017; Bruni, E., Tran, N.K., Baroni, M., Multimodal distributional semantics (2014) J.

Socio-moral reasoning represents a key ability to sustain efficient adaptive social interactions. In the proposed solutions, expert knowledge is first computed using NLP and information retrieval techniques and then added to the DNN architecture using the attentional mechanism. It uses pre-annotated textual data and a coding scheme (SoMoral) applied by experts in psychology. State-of-the-art text classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, etc.) achieved very low results in our context in contrast to LSTM and CNN (when combined with expert knowledge). Our solutions were compared to four models: a CNN-only model, an LSTM-only model, a CNN and an LSTM models where the expert knowledge is concatenated directly with the data (instead of using attention). Experiments show that our models can accurately predict the level of socio-moral reasoning skills. Our findings suggest the need for hybrid neural networks that integrate prior expert knowledge (especially when it is necessary to compensate the strong dependency - of deep learning methods - on data size or the possible unbalanced datasets). © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

But this type of meaning is often implicit, 'hidden' meaning, evoked by linguistic cues, stylistic arrangement, or argumentation structure- features that have hitherto been difficult for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems to recognize and use. Pragmatic concerns were historically the province of rhetorical studies, and we have turned to rhetoric in order to find new solutions to computational pragmatics. This paper highlights a form of rhetorical device that encodes deep levels of pragmatic meaning and yet lends itself to automated detection. These devices are the linguistic configurations known as rhetorical figures, which have been poorly understood and vastly underutilized in Computational Linguistics and Computational Argumentation. We present an annotation scheme using XML for rhetorical figures to make figuration more tractable for NLP, enhancing applications for argument mining, along with a range of other tasks. We also discuss the intellectual and technical challenges involved in figure annotation and the implications for Machine Learning.",,Computation theory; Computational methods; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linguistics; XML; Annotation scheme; Argumentation structures; Automated detection; Deep-levels; New solutions; Technical challenges; Natural language processing systems,"Alexis, A., (2015) Fifteen Dogs, , Toronto: Coach House Books; Alliheedi, M., (2012) Multi-document Summarization System Using Rhetorical Information, , Master of Mathematics thesis, Cheriton School of Computing, University of Waterloo.

While natural language is symbolic in nature and the first approaches in the field were based on symbolic and rule-based methods, like ontologies, semantic networks and knowledge bases, most widely used methods are currently based on statistical approaches, including linear methods, such as support vectors machines or probabilistic topic models, and nonlinear ones such as neural networks. Each of these two main schools of thought in natural language processing, knowledge-based and statistical, have their limitations and strengths and there is an increasing trend that seeks to combine them in complementary ways to get the best of both worlds. This tutorial will cover the foundations and modern practical applications of knowledge-based and statistical methods, techniques and models and their combination for exploiting large document corpora. The tutorial will first focus on the foundations of many of the techniques that can be used to this purpose, including knowledge graphs, word embeddings, neural network methods, and probabilistic topic models, and will then show how these techniques are being effectively combined in practical applications, including commercial projects where the instructors currently participate. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Embeddings; Hybrid natural language processing; Knowledge graphs; Topic models; Vecisgrafo,Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Speech processing; Statistics; Teaching; Artificial intelligence techniques; Embeddings; Knowledge graphs; Large document corpora; Probabilistic topic models; Support vectors machine; Topic model; Vecisgrafo; Knowledge based systems,"Denaux, R., Gomez-Perez, J.M., Towards a vecsigrafo: Portable semantics in knowledge-based text analytics (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 Workshop on Hybrid Statistical Semantic Understanding and Emerging Semantic (HSSUES '17).

Users increasingly expect structured knowledge as answers to their search needs. Using Bing as an example, the result page for 'Lionel Messi' is full of structured knowledge facts, such as his birthday and awards. The research efforts towards improving the accuracy and coverage of such knowledge bases have led to significant advances in Information Extraction techniques [2], [3]. As the initial challenge of accurately extracting facts for popular entities are being addressed, more difficult challenges have emerged such as extending knowledge coverage to long tail entities and domains, understanding interestingness and usefulness of facts within a given context, and addressing information-seeking needs more directly and accurately. In this tutorial, we will survey the recent research efforts and provide an introduction to the techniques that address those challenges, and the applications that benefit from the adoption of those techniques. In particular, this tutorial will focus on a variety of techniques that can be broadly viewed as knowledge inferencing, i.e., combining multiple data sources and extraction techniques to verify existing knowledge and derive new knowledge. More specifically, we focus on four main categories of inferencing techniques: 1) deep natural language processing using machine learning techniques, 2) data cleaning using integrity constraints, 3) large-scale probabilistic reasoning, and 4) leveraging human expertise for domain knowledge extraction. © 2015 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Cleaning; Information analysis; Information management; Information retrieval; Knowledge management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Search engines; Domain knowledge extractions; Extraction techniques; Information extraction techniques; Integrity constraints; Machine learning techniques; Multiple data sources; NAtural language processing; Probabilistic reasoning; Data mining,"Introducing the knowledge graph: Things, not strings (2012) Google, , http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/introducing-knowledge-graphthings-not.html; Barbosa, D., Wang, H., Yu, C., Shallow information extraction for the knowledge web (2013) ICDE, pp. 1264-1267; Suchanek, F.M., Weikum, G., Knowledge harvesting from text and web sources (2013) ICDE, pp. 1250-1253; Etzioni, O., Cafarella, M., Downey, D., Kok, S., Popescu, A.-M., Shaked, T., Soderl, S., Yates, A., Web-scale information extraction in knowitall: (Preliminary results) (2004) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on World Wide Web.

The robot needs to be calibrated to hold the gun and instructed how to pull the trigger. Two algorithms are proposed and are executed depending on the dynamics of the target. If the target is stationery, a least mean square (LMS) approach is used to computethe error and adjust the gun muzzle accordingly. If the target is found to be dynamic, a modified Q-learning is used to best predict the object position and velocity and to adjust relevant parameters, as necessary. The image processing utilizes the OpenCV library to detect the target and point of impact of the bullets. The approach is evaluated on a 53-DOF humanoid robot iCub.

We show how combining two previously distinct lines of work allows us to better address the challenges resulting from this court's unusual tradition of publishing the opinions of multiple judges with no formal statement of the reasoning (if any) agreed by a majority. We do this by applying natural language processing and machine learning, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), to a data set we created by fusing together expert-annotated sentence labels from the HOLJ corpus of rhetorical role summary relevance with the ASMO corpus of agreement statement and majority opinion. By using CRFs and a bespoke summary generator on our enriched data set, we show a significant quantitative F1-score improvement in rhetorical role and relevance classification of 10-15% over the state-of-the-art SUM system; and we show a significant qualitative improvement in the quality of our summaries, which closely resemble gold-standard multi-judge abstracts according to a proof-of-principle user study. © 2020 The Authors, Faculty of Law, Masaryk University and IOS Press.",Legal Summarisation; Machine Learning; UK House of Lords (UKHL),Classification (of information); Information systems; Information use; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Conditional Random Fields(CRFs); Data set; F1 scores; Gold standards; NAtural language processing; Proof of principles; State of the art; User study; Laws and legislation,"Kanapala, A., Text summarization from legal documents: A survey (2019) Artif Intell Rev, 51, pp. 371-402; Williams, G., Learning the law (2010) Sweet & Maxwell, , 14 edition; Hale, B., (2010) Judgment Writing in the Supreme Court-UK Supreme Court Blog (October); Hachey, B., Grover, C., Extractive summarisation of legal texts (2006) Ai and Law, 14 (4), pp. 305-345; Valvoda, J., Using agreement statements to identify majority opinion in ukhl case law (2018) Proc. 31st Int.

Essentially, this task is a text-to-text generation problem but is to learn long text, i.e., greater than 40 words, from a piece of short macro news. Moreover, the core component for human beings to generate financial reports is the logic inference given a piece of succinct macro news. To address this issue, we propose the novel multiple edits neural networks which first learns the outline for given news and then generates financial reports from the learnt outline. Particularly, the input news is first embedded via skip-gram model and is then fed into Bi-LSTM component to train the contextual representation vector. This vector is used to learn the latent word probability distribution for the generation of financial reports. To train this end to end neural network model, we have collected one hundred thousand pairs of news-report data. Extensive experiments are performed on this collected dataset. The proposed model achieves the SOTA performance against baseline models w.r.t. the evaluation criteria BLEU, ROUGE and human scores. Although the readability of the generated reports by our approach is better than that of the rest models, it remains an open problem which needs further efforts in the future. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Financial data mining;

Although a text document expresses a wide range of information, but it lacks the imposed structure of tradition database. Thus, unstructured data, particularly free running text data has to be transferred into a structured data. Hence, in this paper we represent the text document unconventionally by making use of symbolic data analysis concepts. We propose a new method of representing documents based on clustering of term frequency vectors. Term frequency vectors of each cluster are used to form a symbolic representation by the use of Mean and Standard Deviation. Further, term frequency vectors are used in the form a interval valued features. To cluster the term frequency vectors, we make use of Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, Average Linkage, K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithms. To corroborate the efficacy of the proposed model we conducted extensive experimentations on standard datasets like 20 Newsgroup Large, 20 Mini Newsgroup, Vehicles Wikipedia datasets and our own created datasets like Google Newsgroup and Research Article Abstracts. Experimental results reveal that the proposed model gives better results when compared to the state of the art techniques. In addition, as the method is based on a simple matching scheme, it requires a negligible time. © 2014 IEEE.",Classification; Clustering Algorithms; Representation; Text Documents,Classification (of information);

Especially, researches to improve the accuracy of algorithms are being actively conducted, and researches on hardware accelerators that implement such algorithms quickly and efficiently are actively under way. In order to utilize artificial intelligence reasoning ability as well as computing speed in mobile or embedded environment, it is necessary to reduce the power consumption and memory usage of artificial intelligence hardware. In this paper, we propose a algorithm to reduce the computational complexity in designing the CNN accelerator.

The use of CBR promises a continuous increase in answer quality, given user feedback that extends the case base. In the paper, we present the complete approach, emphasizing the use of CBR techniques, namely the structural case base, built with annotated MultiNet graphs, and corresponding graph similarity measures. We cover a priori relations to experienced answer candidates for former questions. We describe the adequate structuring of the case base and develop appropriate similarity measures. Finally we integrate CBR into an existing framework for answer validation and reranking that also includes logical answer validation and a shallow linguistic validation, using a learning-to-rank approach for the final answer ranking based on CBR-related features. In our experiments on QA@CLEF questions, the best learned models make heavy use of CBR features. The advantage already achieved by CBR will increase with time due to the automatic improvement with new user annotations given by relevance feedback. © 2012 IEEE.",answer validation; case-based reasoning; learning to rank; machine learning; question answering systems,answer validation; Case base; Case-based reasoning approaches; CBr; Graph similarity measures; Integrated machines; Learning to rank; Question answering systems; Re-ranking; Relevance feedback; Similarity measure; User annotations; User feedback; Feedback; Natural language processing systems; Learning systems,"Furbach, U., Gl̈ockner, I., Pelzer, B., An application of automatedreasoning in natural language question answering (2010) AI Communications, 23 (2-3), pp. 241-265; Gl̈ockner, I., Finding answer passages with rank optimizing decisiontrees (2009) Proc. of the 8th Int.

A great deal of attention has been attracted in recent years, toward both science and industry fields for a variety of uses. Machine learning and the text mining uses this most widely known application area of sentiment analysis. This paper presents a framework for efficient multilevel sentiment analysis using fuzzy logic for the classification of online test reviews polarity as strong positive, positive, negative and strong negative. This proposed model can use the fuzzy logic classifier to enhance the degree of sentiment polarity of reviews. Here, fuzzy logic classifier is used for finding the sentiment classes. This also utilizes the mechanism of imputation of missing sentiment for integrating non-opinionated sentences in generating precise results. Results show that the proposed method has a capability of extracting opinions and classify them in an effective way. The proposed method has a capability to predict the degree of sentiment polarity for the reviews on a social media. The better precision and F1-scores are obtained for an objective/subjective classification and polarity (positive/negative) classification on twitter dataset. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Fuzzy logic classification; Machine learning; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis,Classification (of information); Computer circuits; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Text mining; Application area; F1 scores; Fuzzy logic classifiers; On-line tests; Positive/negative; Social media; Fuzzy logic,,"Hegde, N.P.; Vasavi College of EngineeringIndia; email: nagaratnaph@staff.vce.ac.in",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"4th International Conference on Smart Computing and Informatics, SCI 2020",9 October 2020 through 10 October 2020,,262569,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112188450

Unfortunately, commercial purposes often lead to confusion in defining the functionalities of human-machine interfaces (HMIs), whereas such AI tools should have to efficiently imitate or replace human beings and body parts in specific cognitive tasks. Instead, AI is often defined too vaguely, that is, not from an anthropic point of view, and therefore, it remains quite distant from the human activities it tries to imitate. Today, AI is categorized among the cognitive sciences, i.e., those sciences that call upon computational neuro-biology (particularly neural networks), mathematical logic (as a part of mathematics and philosophy), and computer science. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial Intelligence; Formal Semantics; Fuzzy Logic; Lexicon-Grammar; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; NooJ; NooJ FSA/FSTs; NooJ local grammars; Ontologies; Question-answering systems,Computation theory; Natural language processing systems; Body parts; Cognitive science; Cognitive task; Human activities; Human being; Human Machine Interface; Artificial intelligence,"Gross, M., (1975) Méthodes En Syntaxe: régime Des Constructions complétives, , Hermann, Paris; Gross, M., Les bases empiriques de la notion de prédicat sémantique (1981) Paris, Langages, 63; Gross, M., (1968) Grammaire Transformationnelle Du français: Tome, 1. , Syntaxe du verbe, Paris, Larousse; Gross, M., (1996) Grammaire Transformationnelle Du français: Tome, 2. , Syntaxe du nom, Paris, Cantilène; Silberztein, M., (2003) The Nooj Manual, , https://www.nooj-association.org; Silberztein, M., (2016) Formalizing Natural Languages: The Nooj Approach, , Wiley, London; Enciclopedia Treccani On-line page. https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/intelligenza-artifi ciale/.

In our experiment, we present an architecture that derives vector representations (i.e., word2vec) of the phrase level sentences. We use some combination of quantitative and qualitative methods for training a recurrent neural network with empirically cross-validating gold-standard array of lexical features, which are precisely synced with sentiment in microblog-like pieces. We leverage a new technique that expands upon previous works on sentence-level lexical sentiment classification, using recurrent fuzzy neural network and use it jointly with a Recursive Neural Network to further improve the classification. We have tested our algorithm against the other state-of-the-art methods on various platforms for better demonstration of our experiment with satisfactory and competitive results. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Deep learning; Fuzzy logic; Machine learning; Recurrent neural network; Sentiment analysis; Social media analysis; Word2vec,Computer circuits; Data mining; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Quantitative and qualitative methods; Recurrent fuzzy neural network; Recursive neural networks; Sentiment classification; Social media analysis; State-of-the-art methods; Vector representations; Word2vec; Fuzzy logic,"Deriu, J., Leveraging large amounts of weakly supervised data for multi-language sentiment classification (2017) Proceedings of the 26Th International Conference on World Wide Web.

The first is that the task has been explored using only symbolic approaches, i.e., Using manually extracted lexical patterns. The second is related to the domain of the lexical patterns, which were extracted through the analysis of a corpus of academic texts, generating many domain-specific patterns. For English, many approaches have been explored using machine learning with features based on a prominent lexicon-syntax notion of dominance sets.

NER is a crucial component of biomedical text mining because it allows for information retrieval, reasoning and knowledge discovery. Much research has been carried out in this area using semantic type categories, such as ""DNA"", ""RNA"", ""proteins"" and ""genes"". However, disease NER has not received its needed attention yet, specifically human disease NER. Traditional machine learning approaches lack the precision for disease NER, due to their dependence on token level features, sentence level features and the integration of features, such as orthographic, contextual and linguistic features. In this paper a method for disease NER is proposed which utilizes sentence and token level features based on Conditional Random Fields using the NCBI disease corpus. Our system utilizes rich features including orthographic, contextual, affixes, bigrams, part of speech and stem based features. Using these feature sets our approach has achieved a maximum F-score of 94% for the training set by applying 10 fold cross validation for semantic labeling of the NCBI disease corpus. For testing and development corpus the model has achieved an F-score of 88% and 85% respectively. © 2016, CEUR-WS.

In text co-clustering, the input data matrix is a high dimension and sparse matrix, and the traditional co-clustering ignores the similarity between word and word, and the similarity between text and word. In this work, we propose a text co-clustering using matrix block and correlation coefficient. In the first step, the matrix block and correlation coefficient are used to reduce dimension, and the relevant feature terms are merged as a hybrid feature term. In the second step, the text terms are clustered using K-means algorithm. And in the last step, the hybrid feature terms and text terms are iteratively clustered by the adjusting algorithms.

Despite the evolution of deep-learning-based image and text processing systems, multimodal matching remains a challenging problem. In this work, we consider the problem of accurate image-text matching for the task of multi-modal large-scale information retrieval. State-of-the-art results in image-text matching are achieved by inter-playing image and text features from the two different processing pipelines, usually using mutual attention mechanisms. However, this invalidates any chance to extract separate visual and textual features needed for later indexing steps in large-scale retrieval systems. In this regard, we introduce the Transformer Encoder Reasoning Network (TERN), an architecture built upon one of the modern relationship-aware self-attentive architectures, the Transformer Encoder (TE). This architecture is able to separately reason on the two different modalities and to enforce a final common abstract concept space by sharing the weights of the deeper transformer layers. Thanks to this design, the implemented network is able to produce compact and very rich visual and textual features available for the successive indexing step. Experiments are conducted on the MS-COCO dataset, and we evaluate the results using a discounted cumulative gain metric with relevance computed exploiting caption similarities, in order to assess possibly non-exact but relevant search results. We demonstrate that on this metric we are able to achieve state-of-the-art results in the image retrieval task.

In contrast, other systems provide symbolic linguistic representation, such as phoneme transcriptions into speech. Synthesized speech is generated by bringing together units of recorded speech that are saved in a repository. The speech units, which come in diphones or tablets, differ in size depending on the system. Even though this provides the most comprehensive performance range, it can also require more clarity. The storage of whole words or sentences in explicit usage areas is the foundation of high-quality production. There have been pre-trained end-to-end TTS systems applied to other languages. In this work, we study the use of an end-to-end Tacotron when applied Arabic text. Arabic is morphologically rich and vague, and it has many dialects that vary significantly from one another. There are no official spelling norms in the dialects, and uncorrected standard Arabic includes numerous spelling and grammar errors and hence is a very challenging problem. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

As suggested by many researchers, Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests, which is widely regarded as one of the predominant benchmarks for measuring human intelligence, raises an interesting challenge for AI systems. For better solving IQ tests automatedly by machines, one needs to use, combine and advance many areas in AI including knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, natural language processing and image understanding. Also, automated IQ tests provides an ideal testbed for integrating symbolic and subsymbolic approaches as both are found useful here. Hence, we argue that IQ tests, although not suitable for testing machine intelligence, provides an excellent benchmark for the current development of AI research. Nevertheless, most existing IQ test datasets are not comprehensive enough for this purpose. As a result, the conclusions obtained are not representative. To address this issue, we create IQ10k, a large-scale dataset that contains more than 10,000 IQ test questions. We also conduct a comparison study on IQ10k with a number of state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Especially, the HTML contents contain valuable information about the individual health condition and graph knowledge presents the semantics of words in the contents. This paper focuses on combining these two for extracting causality knowledge. Understanding causality relations is one of the crucial tasks to support building an Artificial Intelligent (AI) enabled healthcare system. Unlike other raw data sources used by AI processes, the causality semantic dataset is generated in this paper, which is believed to be more efficient and transparent for supporting AI tasks. Currently, neural network-based deep learning processes found themselves in a hard position to explain the prediction outputs, which is majorly because of lacking knowledge-based probability analysis. Dynamic probability analysis based on causality modeling is a new research area that not only can model the knowledge in a machine-understandable way but also can create causal probability relations inside the knowledge. To achieve this, a causal probability generation framework is proposed in this paper that extends the current Description Logic (DL), applies semantic Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach, and calculates runtime causal probabilities according to the given input conditions. The framework can be easily implemented using existing programming standards. The experimental evaluations extract 383 common disease conditions from the UK NHS (the National Health Service) and enable automatically linked 418 condition terms from the DBpedia dataset.

However, the severe impact threat to the algorithm’s performance caused by occlusion still consists of an open issue due to the lack of consistent real-world datasets, richer annotations, and evaluations in the specific occlusion problem. Therefore, unlike previous works in this field, our paper addresses occlusions in scene text recognition. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of existing deep architectures for scene text detection and recognition in various occlusion levels. First, we investigated state-of-the-art scene text and recognition methods and evaluated these current deep architectures performances on ICDAR 2015 dataset without any generated occlusion. Second, we created a methodology to generate large datasets of scene text in natural images with ranges of occlusion between 0 and 100%. From this methodology, we produced the ISTD-OC, a dataset derivated from the ICDAR 2015 database to evaluate deep architectures under different levels of occlusion. The results demonstrated that these existing deep architectures that have achieved state-of-the-art are still far from understanding text instances in a real-world scenario. Unlike the human vision systems, which can comprehend occluded instances by contextual reasoning and association, our extensive experimental evaluations show that current scene text recognition models are inefficient when high occlusions exist in a scene. Nevertheless, for scene text detection, segmentation-based methods, such as PSENet and PAN, are more robust in predicting higher levels of occluded texts. In contrast, methods that detect at the character level, such as CRAFT, are unsatisfactory to heavy occlusions. When it comes to recognition, attention-based methods that benefit contextual information have performed better than CTC-based methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Deep learning; Occlusion; Text scenes,Character recognition; Computer vision; Deep learning; Deep architectures; Deep learning; Natural images; Occlusion; Performance; Scene Text; State of the art; Text detection; Text recognition; Text scene; Large dataset,"Adak, C., Chaudhuri, B.B., Blumenstein, M., Impact of struck-out text on writer identification (2017) 2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Pp. 1465–1471.

While significant work has been done to model these accelerators and create ways to explore their design spaces and have even incorporated external effects like data transfer latency, they do not account for the portion of the workload running on the CPU. When designing an electronic system under constraints, prioritizing the accelerator can harm the power or performance of the CPU and reduce the overall quality of the design when running workloads with significant components on it. In this work, we present several workloads running on a RISC- V system with an accelerator tailored to each one and show how the overall power, performance, and area can benefit in the presence of constraints by co-designing the two parts.

The problem at hand not only involves reasoning over visual elements present in the image or natural language understanding of the input query, but also may involve outside world knowledge in order to infer the answer. In this paper, we convert the VQA problem to a factoid question answering task over a set of natural language facts extracted from images in the Visual Genome Dataset [1]. Recent literatures in textual question answering have established the effectiveness of End to End Memory Networks (MemN2N) over the standard LSTMs. Inspired by the approaches incorporated by researchers in this direction, as a first step to create an explainable VQA model, this paper proposes the incorporation of MemN2N with soft attention for inferring the answer from a set of regional facts extracted from the image. We also experiment with the addition of a Bayesian Neural layer for posterior reasoning of the answer from a fixed vocabulary, as proposed in [2] which shows a significant improvement in the accuracy score compared to the other models tested. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Bayesian inference; End to end memory networks; Factoid question answering; Visual question answering,,"Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Shamma, D.A., Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations (2017) Int.

In order to collect and analyse opinionated content on the Internet, various sentiment detection techniques have been developed based on an integration of part-of-speech tagging, negation handling, lexicons and classifiers. A popular unsupervised approach, SO-LSA (Semantic Orientation from Latent Semantic Analysis), uses a term-document matrix to detect the semantic orientation of words according to their similarities to a predefined set of seed terms. This paper proposes a novel and subsymbolic approach in sentiment detection, with a level of accuracy comparable to the baseline, SO-LSA, using a special type of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), an auto-encoder called Recursive Auto-Associative Memory (RAAM). © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Artificial Neural Network in Natural Language Processing; Recursive Associative Memory; Semantic Clustering; Sentiment Detection,Artificial Neural Network; Artificial Neural Network in Natural Language Processing; Detection technique; Latent Semantic Analysis; matrix; Part of speech tagging; Recursive Associative Memory; Recursive autoassociative memory; Semantic Clustering; Semantic orientation; Social Networks; Sub-symbolic approach; Unsupervised approaches; Associative storage; Computational linguistics; Data mining; Internet; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Semantics; Websites; Associative processing,"Chalmers, D., Syntactic transformations on distributed representations (1990) Connection Science, 2 (1), pp. 53-62; Collobert, R., Weston, J., A unified architecture for natural language processing: Deep neural networks with multitask learning (2008) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), Helsinki, Fabianinkatu, pp. 160-167. , July; Dumais, S., Landauer, T., A solution to platos problem: The latent semantic analysis theory of acquisition, induction and representation of knowledge (1997) Psychological Review, 104, pp. 211-240; Esuli, A., Sebastiani, F., Sentiwordnet: A publicly available lexical resource for opinion mining Proceedings of Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), Genoa, Italy (May 2006); Fellbaum, C., (1998) WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database, , MIT press, Cambridge; Kennedy, A., Inkpen, D., Sentiment classification of movie reviews using contextual valence shifters (2006) Computational Intelligence, 22 (2), pp. 110-125; Miikkulainen, R., Dyer, M., Forming global representations with extended backpropagation (1988) IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 285-292. , IEEE; Moisl, H., Artificial neural networks and natural language processing (2003) Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, pp. 148-162; Pang, B., Lee, L., Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales (2005) Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), Morristown, NJ, USA, pp. 115-124. , June; Pang, B., Lee, L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2008) Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, 2 (1-2), pp. 1-135; Pang, B., Lee, L., A sentimental education: Sentiment analysis using subjectivity summarization based on minimum cuts (2004) Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, p. 271. , Association for Computational Linguistics, Barcelona; Pang, B., Lee, L., Vaithyanathan, S., Thumbs up? sentiment classification using machine learning techniques Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), Philadelphia, PA, USA (July 2002); Pollack, J., Recursive distributed representations (1990) Artificial Intelligence, 46 (1-2), pp. 77-105; Rusu, D., Dali, L., Fortuna, B., Grobelnik, M., Mladenić, D., Triplet extraction from sentences (2007) 10th International Multiconference Information Society-IS, Ljubljana, Slovenia, pp. 8-12. , July; Turney, P., Littman, M., Measuring praise and criticism: Inference of semantic orientation from association (2003) ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 21, pp. 315-346; Whitelaw, C., Argamon, S., Garg, N., Using appraisal taxonomies for sentiment analysis Proceedings of the First Computational Systemic Functional Grammar Conference.

Among the main themes appear Big Data, with cases involving signals, images, texts, and other complex types of data; similarity metric discovery, in the form of weight spaces, feature weights, and feature selection; adaptation knowledge; explainability and transparency; and user centeredness and interactivity. Researchers highlight the advantages of case-based reasoning in terms of its lazy learning, explainability, user centeredness, and interactivity when performing knowledge discovery, as well as how diverse knowledge discovery methods can improve CBR.

Our research is novel and challenging due to the following reasons: 1) a big number of author profiling dimensions, i.e., gender, age, education, marital status and personality type; 2) very short (avg. ~ 24 tokens) non-normative texts; 3) vocabulary rich highly inflective Lithuanian language. We have performed experimental investigation that resulted in choosing automatic author profiling methods (in particular, classifiers and feature types) that have reached the highest accuracy on the pure texts without any meta-information about their authors. Out of a number of experimentally investigated classifiers using lexical or symbolic features the Naïve Bayes Multinomial method with character n-grams feature type yielded the best performance reaching 84.3%, 52.7%, 79.6%, 76.6%, 79.1% of accuracy in gender, age, education, marital status and personality type detection tasks, respectively.

Manual construction of knowledge-bases for complex applications is a time-consuming and expensive process. In such application domains, however, a vast amount of knowledge is available in human-readable format, and it could be leveraged to build knowledge-bases automatically. Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based techniques provide an attractive option for this process. The field of NLP has made rapid strides in last several years and resulted in increased usage across a variety of consumer-facing applications. However, their usage for knowledge-base construction in the aviation industry remains rather limited to date. We present our assessment of using various NLP-based tools for the creation of aviation-focused, high-quality, machine-processable, and human-legible knowledge bases (KBs) for various applications. We identify several gaps, both at the application and fundamental levels, and also identify potential directions for future research that could help overcome the challenges. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to the joint modeling and interdependent fulfilment of both tasks. In particular, document clustering and topic modeling are seamlessly interrelated under an innovative Bayesian generative model of clusters, topics and contents in text corpora. Such a model assumes that text corpora result from a generative process, in which clusters and topics act as connected latent factors. Essentially, clusters are initially associated with descriptive and actionable topic distributions, that enforce cluster coherence. The individual documents are then assigned to one respective cluster and worded accordingly. Under the devised model, document clustering and topic modeling can be simultaneously performed in an interdependent manner simply by Bayesian reasoning. For this purpose, the mathematical details regarding collapsed Gibbs sampling as well as parameter estimation are derived and implemented into an approximate inference algorithm. Comparative experiments on standard benchmark text corpora reveal the effectiveness of our approach at jointly clustering text documents and unveiling their semantics in terms of coherent topics. © 2019 IEEE.",Bayesian Text Analysis; Document Clustering; Topic Modeling,Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Inference engines; Information retrieval; Semantics; Approximate inference; Bayesian generative models; Comparative experiments; Document Clustering; Machine learning approaches; Mathematical details; Text analysis; Topic Modeling; Text mining,"Aggarwal, C., Zhai, C., (2012) A Survey of Text Clustering Algorithms, pp. 77-128. , C.

Logical AI has focused mainly on the former, and statistical AI on the latter. Markov logic combines the two by attaching weights to first-order formulas and viewing them as templates for features of Markov networks. Inference algorithms for Markov logic draw on ideas from satisfiability, Markov chain Monte Carlo and knowledge-based model construction. Learning algorithms are based on the voted perceptron, pseudo-likelihood and inductive logic programming. Markov logic has been successfully applied to a wide variety of problems in natural language understanding, vision, computational biology, social networks and others, and is the basis of the open-source Alchemy system. © 2016 ACM.",first-order logic; machine learning; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Markov networks; probabilistic graphical models; probabilistic inference,Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Chains; Complex networks; Computer circuits; Formal logic; Inference engines; Intelligent agents; Knowledge based systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Open source software; Open systems; Reconfigurable hardware; Speech recognition; First order logic; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Markov networks; Probabilistic graphical models; Probabilistic inference; Inductive logic programming (ILP),"Besag, J., Statistical analysis of non-lattice data (1975) The Statistician, 24, pp. 179-195; Bui, H., Huynh, T., Braz Salvo De, R., Exact lifted inference with distinct soft evidence on every object (2012) Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Bui, H., Huynh, T., Sontag, D., Lifted tree-reweighted variational inference (2014) Proceedings of the Thirtieth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, , AUAI Press; Collins, M., Discriminative training methods for hidden Markov models: Theory and experiments with perceptron algorithms (2002) Proceedings of the 2002 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 1-8. , Philadelphia, PA.

ST is widely used in the domain of industrial automation engineering to create Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programs. ST is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) which is specialized to the Automation Engineering (AE) application domain. ST has specialized features and programming constructs which are different than general purpose programming languages. We define, develop a tool and compute 10 source code metrics and their correlation with each-other at the Code Tab (CT) and Program Organization Unit (POU) level for two real-world industrial projects at a leading automation engineering company. We study the correlation between the 10 ST source code metrics and their relationship with change proneness at the CT and POU level by creating experimental dataset consisting of different versions of the system. We build predictive models using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based techniques to predict change proneness of the software. We conduct a series of experiments using various training algorithms and measure the performance of our approach using accuracy and F-measure metrics. We also apply two feature selection techniques to select optimal features aiming to improve the overall accuracy of the classifier. © 2017 ACM.",Artificial neural networks (ANN); Change proneness prediction; Machine learning applications in software engineering; Programmable logic controller (PLC) applications; Source code analysis; Source code metrics; Structured text (ST),Automation; Codes (symbols); Computer circuits; Controllers; Engineering education; Forecasting; Learning systems; Network coding; Neural networks; Object oriented programming; Problem oriented languages; Programmable logic controllers; Programmed control systems; Change proneness; Machine learning applications; Programmable Logic Controller (PLC); Source code analysis; Source code metrics; Structured text; Application programs,"Demšar, J., Statistical comparisons of classifiers over multiple data sets (2006) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 7, pp. 1-30. , Jan; Fazayeli, F., Wang, L., Mandziuk, J., Feature selection based on the rough set theory and expectation-maximization clustering algorithm (2008) Rough Sets and Current Trends in Computing RSCTC, pp. 272-282; John, K.-H., Tiegelkamp, M., (2010) IEC 61131-3: Programming Industrial Automation Systems: Concepts and Programming Languages, Requirements for Programming Systems, Decision-Making Aids, , Springer Science & Business Media; Güneş Koru, A., Liu, H., Identifying and characterizing change-prone classes in two large-scale open-source products (2007) Journal of Systems and Software, 80 (1), pp. 63-73; Kumar, L., Jetley, R., Sureka, A., Source code metrics for programmable logic controller (plc) ladder diagram (ld) visual programming language (2016) Workshop on Emerging Trends in Software Metrics, WETSoM, pp. 15-21. , ACM; Kumar, L., Rath, S., Sureka, A., Predicting quality of service (qos) parameters using extreme learning machines with various kernel methods (2016) Workshop on Quantitative Approaches to Software Quality (QuASoQ 2016) Co-Located to (APSEC 2016), , CEUR; Lu, H., Zhou, Y., Xu, B., Le-Ung, H., Chen, L., The ability of object-oriented metrics to predict change-proneness: A meta-analysis (2012) Empirical Software Engineering, 17 (3), pp. 200-242; Malian, F.J., Barbancho, J.L.C.M., Leon, C., Malian, A., Gomez, A., Using industrial standards on plc programming learning (2007) Control & Automation, 2007.

Osteoporosis is one of the examples that its symptoms, e.g. knee and back pain, are usually overlooked. In this paper, we implement an osteoporosis prediction system based on text cloud mining analysis to recognize potential osteoporosis patients. The prediction system recognize a potential osteoporosis patient according to his/her symptoms, status, and medical records. A library of use cases are firstly implemented according to collected osteoporosis patients. Similarity measure is calculated for a person and the cases in the library. A person with more similar to the cases of osteoporosis patients means he/she has a higher chance to suffer from osteoporosis. © 2016 IEEE.",Case-Based Reasoning; Osteoporosis; Text Mining; Word Clouds,Case based reasoning; Character recognition; Machine learning; Cloud technologies; Medical record; Osteoporosis; Prediction systems; Predictive models; Similarity measure; Text mining; Word clouds; Diseases,"(2016) Understanding Osteoporosis, , Health Promotion Administration Ministry of Health and Welfare; Wong, G.-Y., Osteoporosis Introduction, 2015. , Jan ; (2015) 'Heaven', 'Site', 'High Calcium' Let You Know How to Keep the Bone in Three Steps, , Health Promotion Administration Ministry of Health and Welfare .Jan; (2006) Invisible Killer on Women's Health - Osteoporosis, , National Health Insurance Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare .Jul; Zhu, Y., Intelligent analysis technology and application of unstructured big data (2015) 2015 Fourth Cross-strait High-end IT Talent Universities Forum, , Beijing, PP.7 JUL.(FIGURE 1); Caiyu, J., (2006) Prospect of Application of Large Data, , Library and Computer Center Home, NUK, Article 46, 2015.Chen Jiawei, ""R for Chinese text Mining"", Department Of Information Management, NUK, Nov; Chen, J., (2006) R for Chinese Text Mining, , Department Of Information Management, NUK, Nov; Bangyan, X., Application of text mining on TCM diagnosis of stroke (2015) ENews; Xie, B., Ding, Y.-T., (2010) Applying Text Mining to Diagnosis Stroke on Traditional Chinese Medicine, , Fu Jen Catholic University Department of Statistics and Information, JUN.

In this work, we propose the design of an explainable, human-in-the-loop, and interactive personal assistant system. The assistant will help a Systems Engineer in their daily work environment through complex information management and high-level question-answering to augment their problem-solving abilities. We describe the fundamental characteristics of the assistant by understanding operational, functional, and system requirements from Systems Engineers and NASA’s Systems Engineering Handbook. The assistant is designed to act as a workbench to manage dynamic information about projects and analyze hypothetical scenarios. It is also designed to make logical inferences and perform temporal reasoning by handling domain information and information related to schedule and resources. In addition, the system learns new information over time by interacting with its user and can perform case-based reasoning from previous experiences. The knowledge base design describes a novel hybrid approach to build a domain-independent common-sense framework with which domain-specific engineers can attune it and build their projects. Using these specific objectives and constraints, the architecture of a personal assistant is proposed. Main contributions of this design paper are Systems Engineering (SE) domain analysis, a survey of existing research, preliminary experiments using the state-of-the-art systems to explore the feasibility, a proposal of a complete architecture with component level detail, and identification of areas that require further research and development.

It also presents the results of a study that allows catching linguistic patterns for extrapunitive responses (E-reactions) aimed at protecting the “Self”; and shows the results of experiments with the Rosenzweig picture-frustration test protocols. We use a linguistic analyzer, “PCA Machine”, which considers the wide range of multi-level features aggregated by the relational-situational model to process the texts with E-reactions to frustration. Then we developed a set of templates, which can catch the revealed linguistic patterns and use them together with machine learning models. This approach turns out to be new for modeling the reasoning of expert cognitive research. Experimental results show that in most cases, the templates allow detecting E-reactions. Moreover, the share of unrecognized reactions is small; however, to increase the recognition reliability, it is necessary to consider additional features, including the context of the analyzed text fragments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Linguistic template; Reaction on frustration; Relational-situational analysis; Rosenzweig picture-frustration study,Artificial intelligence; Linguistics; Automated recognition; Automatic recognition; Linguistic patterns; Machine learning models; Multilevels; Situational modeling; Test protocols; Text fragments; Character recognition,"Rosenzweig, S., Types of reaction to frustration (1934) J.

This joint task has not received the required attention, due to the lack of databases targeting this specific task, as well as all the additional challenges imposed for the separate tasks of text recognition and VQA. In this paper, we present a complete methodology to address this important task, by designing strategies that process the different components involved in the system.

We use Java language to implement finite state machine logic and rule engine, Xml language to describe the finite state transducer rules of the Turkish language, which makes the morphological analyzer both easily extendible and easily applicable to other languages. Empowered with a comprehensive lexicon of 54,000 bare-forms including 19,000 proper nouns, our morphological analyzer is amongst the most reliable analyzers produced so far. The analyzer is compared with Turkish morphological analyzers in the literature. By using LRU cache and a trie data structure, the system can analyze 100,000 words per second, which enables users to analyze huge corpora in a few hours. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

Elaborated feedback is thus a challenge for AI in education systems because it requires dynamic explanations, which traditionally require logical reasoning and knowledge engineering to generate. This study presents an alternative approach that formulates elaborated feedback in terms of long-form question answering (LFQA). An off-the-shelf LFQA system was evaluated by human raters in a 2x2x2x2 ablation design that manipulated the context documents given to the LFQA model and the post-processing of model output. Results indicate that context manipulations improve performance but that post-processing can have detrimental results. © 2021 ACM.",deep learning; elaborated feedback; human evaluation; information retrieval; natural language generation; question answering,Ablation; Education systems; Improve performance; Logical reasoning; Model outputs; Post processing; Question Answering; Education computing,"Aleven, V., McLaren, B., Roll, I., Koedinger, K., Toward tutoring help seeking (2004) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, James C.

But, so far, only few attempts have been made to model mathematical cognition in robots. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the Long- Short Term Memory networks for modeling the simple mathematical operation of single-digits addition in a cognitive robot. To this end, the robotic model creates an association between the proprioceptive information from finger counting and the handwritten digits of the MNIST dataset. In practice, the model executes two tasks concurrently: It recognizes the handwritten digits in a sequence and sums them. The results show that the association with fingers can improve the robot precision, as observed in children. Also, the robot makes a disproportionate number of split-five errors similarly to what observed in studies with children and adults, hence giving evidence to support the hypothesis that these errors are due the use of a five-fingers counting system. © 2018 IEEE.",Cognitive Developmental Robotics; Deep Learning; Long Short-Term Memory networks; Mathematical Cognition,Brain; Character recognition; Deep learning; Functions; Long short-term memory; Robotics; Cognitive functions; Developmental robotics; Experimental evaluation; Mathematical Cognition; Mathematical operations; Natural language understanding; Short term memory; Symbolic processing; Robots,"Aunio, P., Räsänen, P., Core numerical skills for learning mathematics in children aged five to eight years-a working model for educators (2016) Eur.

Yet there has been evidence that current benchmark datasets suffer from bias, and current state-of-the-art models cannot be easily evaluated on their intermediate reasoning process. To address these issues and complement similar efforts in visual question answering, we build CLEVR-Ref+, a synthetic diagnostic dataset for referring expression comprehension. The precise locations and attributes of the objects are readily available, and the referring expressions are automatically associated with functional programs. The synthetic nature allows control over dataset bias (through sampling strategy), and the modular programs enable intermediate reasoning ground truth without human annotators. In addition to evaluating several state-of-the-art models on CLEVR-Ref+, we also propose IEP-Ref, a module network approach that significantly outperforms other models on our dataset. In particular, we present two interesting and important findings using IEP-Ref: (1) the module trained to transform feature maps into segmentation masks can be attached to any intermediate module to reveal the entire reasoning process step-by-step; (2) even if all training data has at least one object referred, IEP-Ref can correctly predict no-foreground when presented with false-premise referring expressions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct and quantitative proof that neural modules behave in the way they are intended. We will release data and code for CLEVR-Ref+. © 2019 IEEE.",Datasets and Evaluation; Deep Learning; Vision + Language; Visual Reasoning,Computer vision; Deep learning; Image segmentation; Natural language processing systems; Object detection; Datasets and Evaluation; Functional programs; Question Answering; Referring expressions; Sampling strategies; Segmentation masks; Visual information; Visual reasoning; Visual languages,"Andreas, J., Rohrbach, M., Darrell, T., Klein, D., Neural module networks (2016) CVPR, pp. 39-48. , IEEE Computer Society; Antol, S., Agrawal, A., Lu, J., Mitchell, M., Batra, D., Zitnick, C.L., Parikh, D., Vqa: Visual question answering (2015) ICCV, pp. 2425-2433. , IEEE Computer Society; Cirik, V., Morency, L., Berg-Kirkpatrick, T., Visual referring expression recognition: What do systems actually learn?

Dynamic workflows are being used increasingly due to their flexibility in a working environment where they minimize mundane tasks like long-term maintenance and increase productivity by automatically responding to changes and introducing new processes. Constant changes within unstable environments where information may be sparse, inconsistent and uncertain can create a bottleneck to a workflow in predicting behaviours effectively. Within a business environment, automatic applications like customer support, complex incidents can be regarded as instances of a dynamic process since mitigation policies have to be responsive and adequate to any case no matter its unique nature. Support engineers work with any means at their disposal to solve any emerging case and define a custom prioritization strategy, to achieve the best possible result. This paper describes a novel workflow architecture for heavy knowledge-related application workflows to address the tasks of high solution accuracy and shorter prediction resolution time. We describe how policies can be generated against cases deriving from heterogeneous workflows to assist experts and domain-specific reusable cases can be generated for similar problems. Our work is evaluated using data from real business process workflows across a large number of different cases and working environments. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Business processes; Case-Based Reasoning; Deep learning; Natural language processing,Computer software reusability; Deep learning; Memory architecture; Natural language processing systems; Automatic application; Business environments; Business Process; Long-term maintenances; Mitigation policies; NAtural language processing; Shorter prediction; Working environment; Case based reasoning,"Kapetanakis, S., Petridis, M., Knight, B., Ma, J., Bacon, L., A case based reasoning approach for the monitoring of business workflows (2010) ICCBR 2010.

Word problems are any numerical problems written in natural languages like English, based on any subject domain (mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, etc.), and MWPs relate to word problems in the mathematics domain. Solving MWPs has been a long-lasting open research problem in the field of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligent (AI); however, unlike other research problems in NLP, ML, and AI, it has not made much progress. MWPs which can be easily solved by second-grade students can often pose serious challenges to MWP solvers due to its diverse problem types and varying degree of complexities. Understanding such problems written in natural language requires proper reasoning toward equation formation and answer generation. We restrict the review in this survey only to research on solving arithmetic word problems from elementary school level mathematics. We analyzed all the important methodologies proposed by researchers along with the datasets they used for training and evaluation. We studied the technical aspects of the system components and the algorithms relevant to their research along with the scopes, constraints, and limitations. This review paper also discusses the performance of different MWP solvers and provides observations on related datasets. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Artificial intelligent; Degree of complexity; Elementary schools; Natural languages; Numerical problems; Research problems; System components; Technical aspects; Problem solving,"Bakman, Y., (2007) Robust Understanding of Word Problems with Extraneous Information, , arXiv; Bobrow, D.G., (1964) Natural Language Input for a Computer Problem Solving System; Briars, D.J., Larkin, J.H., An integrated model of skill in solving elementary word problems (1984) Cognit.

In this content the anomalous user can misbehave or can be involved in unsocial activity over the clean environment. Furthermore people frequently use symbolic forms to convert other person by which pattern of unsolicited can be recognized by analysis these content. Therefore in this research paper we are going to investigate the different technique and approaches that recently developed by different researchers. Finally we proposed a model by associating this method for this conversion. Data mining and machine learning, offers to evaluate the data automatically for different applications. In order to perform such task the classification and clustering techniques are used. The classification of data is a supervised learning process thus the technique needs a set of attributes (patterns) and the associated class labels. The algorithm first prepare the mathematical model using the previous patterns of training sets and further these models are used to evaluate the test sets. Thus a two different classifiers namely Bayesian classifier and k-nearest neighbour algorithm is studied. Moreover, some of authors are suggested to implement the fuzzy classification technique for achieving the high accurate results. Therefore a new method using the fuzzy concept is proposed and implemented. Additionally the classical text classification models are used for comparative performance study. The comparative performance study shows the effectiveness of the proposed classification technique and able to produce the more accurate results as compared to traditional classifiers. © 2016 IEEE.",data mining; fuzzy logic; machine learning; text mining,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data handling; Data mining; Information analysis; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Social networking (online); Text processing; Classification and clustering; Classification of data; Classification technique; Comparative performance; Fuzzy classification; K-nearest neighbour algorithms; Text classification models; Text mining; Fuzzy logic,"Vanetti, M., Binaghi, E., Ferrari, E., Carminati, B., Carullo, M., A system to filter unwanted messages from OSN User Walls (2013) IEEE Transections on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 25; Data Mining: What Is Data Mining, , http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/jasonfriend/teacher/technologies/palace/datamining.htm; What Is Data Mining Application DataMining-Applications&Trends, , http://www.tutorialspoint.com/datamining/dmapplicationstrends.htm; Chowdhary, M., Suri, S., Bhutani, M., Comparative study of intrusion detection system (2014) IJCSE, 2 (4); Muley, P., Joshi, A., Application of data mining techniques for customer segmentation in real time business intelligence (2015) International Journal of Innovative Research in Advanced Engineering (IJIRAE), 2 (4). , April; Krishna, B.V.R., Sushma, B., Novel approach to museums development & emergence of text mining International Journal of Computer Technology and Electronics Engineering (IJCTEE), 2 (2); Luhn, H.P., A business intelligence system IBM Research Journals, 2, p. 314. , Nontopical Issue; Hotho, A., Nurnberger, A., Paab, G., AiS, F., (2005) A Brief Survey of Text Mining, , May 13 Knowledge Discovery Group Sankt Augustin; Nguyen, H., Santos, E., Russell, J., Evaluation of the impact of user-cognitive styles on the assessment of text summarization (2011) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A: Systems and Humans, 41 (6). , November; Thanamani, A.S., An analysis on text mining-text retrieval and text extraction (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 2 (8). , U.

Existing IT artifacts mainly focus on tackling diagnostic errors caused by system flaws but fail to address users' cognitive biases. In view of it, we systematically design a two-phase framework to proactively enrich medical professionals' knowledge on diagnostic errors and to manage cognitive biases. Specifically, we first employ natural language processing techniques including BI-LSTM-CRF to extract misdiagnosis relations from medical literature, which are then stored in the misdiagnosis database. Secondly, we conduct in-depth knowledge discovery, including rule-based reasoning, network analysis and exploratory analysis to uncover the hidden knowledge on diagnostic errors from the constructed database. The on-going experiment verifies the effectiveness of BI-LSTM-CRF on performing the misdiagnosis relation extraction task. Our proposed framework serves as a promising infrastructure in both Healthcare IS and medical research for improving patient safety. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.",Cognitive biases; Deep learning; Diagnostic error; Misdiagnosis database,Database systems; Deep learning; Errors; Information systems; Information use; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; Cognitive bias; Diagnostic errors; Exploratory analysis; Hidden knowledge; Medical literatures; Medical professionals; NAtural language processing; Relation extraction; Diagnosis,"Aron, R., Dutta, S., Janakiraman, R., Pathak, P.A., The impact of automation of systems on medical errors: Evidence from field research (2011) Information Systems Research, 22 (3), pp. 429-446; Croskerry, P., The importance of cognitive errors in diagnosis and strategies to minimize them (2003) Academic Medicine, 78 (8), pp. 775-780; Graber, M.L., Franklin, N., Gordon, R., Diagnostic error in internal medicine (2005) Archives of Internal Medicine, 165 (13), pp. 1493-1499; Graber, M.L., Kissam, S., Payne, V.L., Meyer, A.N.D., Sorensen, A., Lenfestey, N., Tant, E., Singh, H., Cognitive interventions to reduce diagnostic error: A narrative review (2012) BMJ Qual Saf, p. 2011. , 2011; Hevner, A.R., March, S.T., Park, J., Ram, S., Design science in information systems research (2004) MIS Quarterly, 28 (1), pp. 75-105; Huang, Z., Xu, W., Yu, K., (2015) Bidirectional Lstm-Crf Models for Sequence Tagging, , arXiv preprint; Hydari, M.Z., Telang, R., Marella, W.M., Electronic health records and patient safety (2015) Communications of the ACM, 58 (11), pp. 30-32; Kohli, R., Kettinger, W.J., Informating the clan: Controlling physicians' costs and outcomes (2004) MIS Quarterly, pp. 363-394; Kohli, R., Tan, S.S.-L., Electronic health records: How can is researchers contribute to transforming healthcare?

But such meaning has always proven computationally allusive. It is often implicit, 'hidden' meaning, evoked by linguistic cues, stylistic arrangement, or conceptual structure - features that have hitherto been difficult for Natural Language Processing systems to recognize and use. Non-denotative textual effects are the historical concern of rhetorical studies, and we have turned to rhetoric in order to find new ways to advance NLP, especially for sophisticated tasks like Argument Mining. This paper highlights certain rhetorical devices that encode levels of meaning that have been overlooked in Computational Linguistics generally and Argument Mining particularly, and yet lend themselves to automated detection. These devices are the linguistic configurations known as Rhetorical Figures. We argue for the importance of these devices for Argument Mining, especially in collocations, and we present an XML annotation scheme for Rhetorical Figures to make figuration more tractable for computational approaches, particularly with an eye on the improvements they offer Argument Mining. We also discuss the intellectual and technical challenges involved in figure annotation and the implications for Machine Learning. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.",annotation; argument mining; Rhetoric; rhetorical figures; XML,Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linguistics; XML; annotation; Annotation scheme; Automated detection; Computational approach; Conceptual structures; Rhetoric; rhetorical figures; Technical challenges; Natural language processing systems,"Alexis, A., (2015) Fifteen Dogs, , Coach House Books, Toronto; Alliheedi, M., (2012) Multi-document Summarization System Using Rhetorical Information, , Master's thesis, supervised by Chrysanne DiMarco, Randy Allen Harris, second reader; Alliheedi, M., DiMarco, C., Rhetorical figuration as a metric in text summarization (2014) Proceedings, 2014 Canadian Artificial Intelligence Conference, , 2014 May 6-9, Montreal, QC; Burke, K., (1969) The Grammar of Motives, , University of California Press, Berkeley, CA; Bush, G.W., Frum, D., Address before a joint session of the congress on the United States response to the terrorist attacks of September 11 (2001) The American Presidency Project, , http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=64731, G.

It evaluates the potential of deep learning and state-of-the-art NLP tools in automated essay scoring (AES) to predict not only holistic scores but also the finer-grained rubric scores, an area underexplored but essential to provision formative feedback and uncover the AI reasoning behind AES. For comparison purpose, this paper advocates the need for transparency when sharing AES processes and outcomes. Finally, it reveals the insufficiency of ASAP essay datasets to train generalizable AES models by examining the distributions of holistic and rubric scores. Findings show that the strength of agreement between human and machine graders on holistic scores does not translate into similar strength on rubric scores and that the learning made by the machine barely exceeds the performance of a naïve predictor. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

There is an opportunity for AI Planning to be applied, which offers reasoning about action trajectories to help build automation blueprints. AI Planning is a problem-solving technique, where knowledge about available actions and their consequences is used to identify a sequence of actions, which, when applied in a given initial state, satisfy a desired goal. AI Planning has successfully been applied in a number of domains ranging from space applications, logistics and transportation, manufacturing, robotics, scheduling, e-learning, enterprise risk management, and service composition. In this paper, we discuss experience in building automation solutions that employ AI planning for use in enterprise IT and business services, such as change and event management, migration and transformation and RPA composition.

Maestro reduces under-utilization common for a single large SA by allowing parallel use of many smaller SAs on DNN weight matrices of varying shapes and sizes. In order to buffer immediate results in memory blocks (MBs) and provide coordinated high-bandwidth communication between SAs and MBs in transferring weights and results Maestro employs three innovations. (1) An SA on the logic die can access its corresponding MB on the memory die in short distance using 3D-IC interconnects, (2) through an efficient switch based on H-trees, an SA can access any MB with low latency, and (3) the switch can combine partial results from SAs in an elementwise fashion before writing back to a destination MB. We describe the Maestro architecture, including a circuit and layout design, detail scheduling of the switch, analyze system performance for real-time inference applications using input with batch size equal to one, and showcase applications for deep learning inference, with ShiftNet for computer vision and recent Transformer models for natural language processing. For the same total number of systolic cells, Maestro, with multiple smaller SAs, leads to 16x and 12x latency improvements over a single large SA on ShiftNet and Transformer, respectively. Compared to a floating-point GPU implementation of ShiftNet and Transform, a baseline Maestro system with 4,096 SAs (each with 8x8 systolic cells) provides significant latency improvements of 30x and 47x, respectively. © 2019 IEEE.",Combining switch; Computer architecture; Convolutional neural network; Deep neural network; Memory-on-logic 3D-IC; Systolic arrays; Transformer,Computer architecture; Computer circuits; Deep neural networks; Digital arithmetic; Memory architecture; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Parallel architectures; Three dimensional integrated circuits; Combining switches; Convolutional neural network; High bandwidth communication; Memory on logic; NAtural language processing; Real-time inference; Transformer; Transformer models; Systolic arrays,"Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., Devin, M., Isard, M., Tensorflow: A system for largescale machine learning (2016) 12th {USENIX} Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation ({OSDI} 16), pp. 265-283; Clos, C., A study of non-blocking switching networks (1953) Bell System Technical Journal, 32 (2), pp. 406-424; Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database CVPR '09; Gao, M., Pu, J., Yang, X., Horowitz, M., Tetris: Scalable and efficient neural network acceleration with 3d memory ASPLOS '17; Gupta, S., Agrawal, A., Gopalakrishnan, K., Narayanan, P., Deep learning with limited numerical precision ICML '15; Jouppi, N.P., Young, C., Patil, N., Patterson, D., In-datacenter performance analysis of a tensor processing unit ISCA '17; Kim, D., Kung, J., Chai, S., Yalamanchili, S., Mukhopadhyay, S., Neurocube: A programmable digital neuromorphic architecture with high-density 3d memory ISCA '16; Kung, H.T., McDanel, B., Zhang, S.Q., Packing sparse convolutional neural networks for efficient systolic array implementations: Column combining under joint optimization ASPLOS '19; Kung, H.T., McDanel, B., Zhang, S.Q., Systolic building block for logic-on-logic 3d-ic implementations of convolutional neural networks ISCAS '19; Lin, D., Talathi, S., Annapureddy, S., Fixed point quantization of deep convolutional networks (2016) International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 2849-2858; McDanel, B., Zhang, S.Q., Kung, H.T., Dong, X., Full-stack optimization for accelerating cnns using powers-of-two weights with FPGA validation ICS '19; Papineni, K., Roukos, S., Ward, T., Zhu, W.-J., Bleu: A method for automatic evaluation of machine translation ACL '02; Paszke, A., Gross, S., Chintala, S., Chanan, G., Yang, E., DeVito, Z., Lin, Z., Lerer, A., Automatic differentiation in pytorch (2017) NIPS-W; Peters, M.E., Neumann, M., Iyyer, M., (2018) Deep Contextualized Word Representations; Radford, A., Wu, J., Child, R., Luan, D., Amodei, D., Sutskever, I., (2019) Language Models Are Unsupervised Multitask Learners; Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A.N., Kaiser, P.I., Attention is all you need (2017) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 5998-6008; Wu, B., Wan, A., Yue, X., Jin, P., Shift: A zero flop, zero parameter alternative to spatial convolutions CVPR '18; (2018) Accelerating Dnns with Xilinx Alveo Accelerator Cards, , Xilinx Technical report, Xilinx, October",,"Deepoly;et al.;FutureWei Technologies, Inc.;IMO Ventures;Sensetime;WITINMEM",IEEE,"30th IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors, ASAP 2019",15 July 2019 through 17 July 2019,,151785,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072608120

The reason behind this is that matching patient information to the eligibility criteria for clinical trials is a manual, effort-consuming process. Therefore, automating this process is an essential step in improving the number of patients participating in clinical research. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for automated patients to clinical trials matching. The matching process is based on measuring the similarity score between phrases extracted from patient medical records and the eligibility criterion for a trial. Our solution is based on a combination of NLP techniques and modern deep learning-based NLP models. In this context, we follow pre-training and transfer learning approaches to help the model learn task-specific reasoning skills. Additionally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on large Medical Natural Language Inference (MedNLI) and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS-B) datasets. The matching process was performed at semantic phrases level by converting patient information and trial criteria into vector representations. We then used a scoring function that combined cosine similarity and scaling normalization to identify potential patient-trial matches. The experimental results have shown that our framework is highly effective in sorting out patients by their similarity scores. Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

To characterize the evidence humans might want to provide, we conducted a user study and a data experiment. In the user study, 75 participants provided classification labels for 20 photos, justifying those labels with free-text explanations. Explanations frequently referenced concepts (objects and attributes) in the image, yet 26% of explanations invoked concepts not in the image. Boolean logic was common in implicit form, but was rarely explicit. In a follow-up experiment on the Visual Genome dataset, we found that some concepts could be partially defined through their relationship to frequently co-occurring concepts, rather than only through labeling. © 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Data labeling; Explanations; Machine teaching; ML,Text processing; Boolean logic; Classification labels; Data labeling; Explanations; Free texts; Implicit form; Reduced data; User study; Human computer interaction,"Amershi, S., Cakmak, M., Knox, W.B., Kulesza, T., Power to the people: The role of humans in interactive machine learning (2014) Proceedings of AAAI; Amershi, S., Fogarty, J., Kapoor, A., Tan, D., Effective end-user interaction with machine learning (2011) Proceedings of AAAI; Brooks, M., Amershi, S., Lee, B., Drucker, S.M., Kapoor, A., Simard, P., Fea-tureInsight: Visual support for error-driven feature ideation in text classification (2015) Proceedings of VAST; Buhrmester, M., Kwang, T., Gosling, S.D., Amazon’s Mechanical Turk: A new source of inexpensive, yet high-quality, data?

Recently, many researchers have proposed deep learning based models to learn both speaker-context and sentence-context information interactions. However, the existing models generally learn the sentiment-context interactions by simple non-linear function, which does not focus on affective reasoning and is lack of interpretability. To address those issues, we introduce probabilistic graph model (PGM). Inspired by the interaction matrix of the Coupled HMM, we propose a novel interaction matrix based improvement for output gating mechanism, which contains local 2-order sentiment-context interaction. Then we propose the interaction matrix Based Long Short-Term Memory Network (ConvLSTM), which captures local sentiment-context interactions. Next, inspired by the reasoning of PGM, we develop a novel PGM layer to model global high-order sentiment-context interaction for sentiment label sequence. Finally, we propose PGM Based Hierarchical Affective Reasoning Network (PHARN), which can learn both local and global sentiment-context interaction. Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks. © 2021 IEEE.",conversational sentiment analysis; hierarchical affective reasoning; probabilistic graph model,Big data; Deep learning; Functions; Graph theory; Sentiment analysis; Context information; Gating mechanisms; Interaction matrices; Interpretability; Learning Based Models; Nonlinear functions; Probabilistic graph models; Short term memory; Matrix algebra,"Poria, S., Majumder, N., Mihalcea, R., Emotion recognition in conversation: Research challenges, datasets, and recent advances[J] (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 100943-100953; Poria, S., Cambria, E., Hazarika, D., Majumder, N., Zadeh, A., Morency, L.-P., Context-dependent sentiment analysis in user-generated videos (2017) ACL.; Hazarika, D., Poria, S., Zadeh, A., Cambria, E., Morency, L.-P., Zimmermann, R., Conversational memory network for emotion recognition in dyadic dialogue videos (2018) NAACL.; Jiao, W., Yang, H., King, I., Lyu, M.R., HiGRU: Hierarchical gated recurrent units for utterance-level emotion recognition (2019) NAACL-HLT (1), pp. 397-406; Hazarika, D., Poria, S., Mihalcea, R., Cambria, E., Zimmermann, R., ICON: Interactive conversational memory network for multimodal emotion detection (2018) EMNLP.; Majumder, N., Poria, S., Hazarika, D., Mihalcea, R., Gelbukh, A., Cambria, E., DialogueRNN: An attentive rnn for emotion detection in conversations (2019) Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 33, pp. 6818-6825; Deepanway, G., Navonil, M., Soujanya, P., Ni, C., Alexander, G., (2019) DialogueGCN: A Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Emotion Recognition in Conversation, pp. 154-164; Zhang, D., Wu, L., Sun, C., Li, S., Zhu, Q., Zhou, G., Modeling both context-and speaker-sensitive dependence for emotion detection in multi-speaker conversations (2019) IJCAI, pp. 5415-5421; Liu, W., Wen, Y., Yu, Z., Large-margin softmax loss for convolutional neural networks[c] (2016) ICML., pp. 507-516; Shi, Z., Joydeep, G., (2021) A New Formulation of Coupled Hidden Markov Models; Matthew, B., (1997) Coupled Hidden Markov Models for Modeling Interacting Processes; Huang, Z., Xu, W., Yu, K., Bidirectional lstm-crf models for sequence tagging[J] (2015) Computer Science; Lafferty, J., McCallum, A., Pereira, F., Conditional random fields: Probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequence data (2001) Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML., 1; McCallum, A., Freitag, D., Pereira, F.C.N., Maximum entropy markov models for information extraction and segmentation (2000) Icml., 17; Jianlin, S., (2020) CRF Used, Might As Well Know the Next Faster MEMM?

Current applications for natural language processing range from real-time translation of spoken language through automated discovery of sentiment in online postings to conversational agents embedded in everyday devices. Recent developments in machine learning, combined with the availability of large amounts of labelled training data, have enabled non-structural approaches to surpass classical techniques based on formal grammars, conceptual ontologies and symbolic representations. As the complexity and opaqueness of those stochastic models become more and more evident, however, the question arises if we trade gains in observable performance with a literal loss of understanding. The cybernetic”black box” (Ross Ashby) re-appears as the other participant in the medium of communication. This development, if unchecked, might have fundamental ramifications for the relationship between humans and machines. In this article I present a distinction-based approach to propose a way towards a comprehensive model of communication. First, I critically revisit fundamental concepts traditionally observed by AI research such as information vs. communication, simulation vs. performance and language vs. cognition. I also highlight a few of the contradictory phenomena that we can observe today as a consequence of these choices. Then I make the case for a different set of distinctions. First I consult Niklas Luhmann's sociological theory in order to locate communication firmly within social systems as opposed to minds or organisms. In addition, I propose to make use of Friedemann Schulz von Thun's four-sided model in order to capture aspects of communication that are currently neglected. Finally I advocate for a transdisciplinary approach to explore the full context of communication between humans and machines. © 2019 AISB Convention.All right reserved.",,Artificial intelligence; Computational grammars; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Stochastic systems; Classical techniques; Communication problems; Conversational agents; Fundamental concepts; NAtural language processing; Sociological theories; Symbolic representation; Trans-disciplinary approaches; Stochastic models,"Allen, J.F., (1995) Natural Language Understanding, , Benjamin/Cummings, Redwood City, Calif., 2. ed., 3rd print edn, OCLC: 245657643; Allwood, J., A bird's eye view of pragmatics (1978) Papers from the Fourth Scandinavian Conference of Linguistics, pp. 145-159. , Kirsten Gregersen,.

Task 11 - Machine comprehension using Commonsense Knowledge - from SemEval 2018 proposes a corpus of such texts, questions and answers. Since the predicates identified by Semantic Role Labeling aim to capture the semantic of a sentence, they seem appropriate to the task of text comprehension. We propose a Context-Novelty based model for identification of the correct answer for a question. This model relies on the SRL predicates of the text, question and answers and (i) it targets identification of the parts from the text which are relevant to the current question and (ii) it measures how well the answer matches that parts. The performance of the model was evaluated directly by counting the number of correctly answered questions and by its integration to a classical machine learning process. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",Commonsense reasoning; ConceptNet; Semantic roles,Learning systems; Commonsense knowledge; Commonsense reasoning; ConceptNet; Question Answering; Semantic role labeling; Semantic roles; Text comprehensions; Semantics,"Baker, C.F., Sato, H., The FrameNet data and software (2003) The Companion Volume to the Proceedings of 41St Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics; Chen, D., Bolton, J., Manning, C.D., A thorough examination of the CNN/daily mail reading comprehension task (2016) Proceedings of the 54Th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 2358-2367. , Association for Computational Linguistics; He, L., Lee, K., Lewis, M., Zettlemoyer, L.S., Deep semantic role labeling: What works and what’s next (2017) ACL; Maccartney, B., Manning, C.D., Natural logic for textual inference (2007) Proceedings of the ACL-PASCAL Workshop on Textual Entailment and Paraphrasing, RTE 2007, pp. 193-200; Merkhofer, E., Henderson, J., Bloom, D., Strickhart, L., Zarrella, G., MITRE at SemEval-2018 Task 11: Commonsense reasoning without commonsense knowledge (2018) Proceedings of the 12Th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 1078-1082. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Ostermann, S., Roth, M., Modi, A., Thater, S., Pinkal, M., SemEval-2018 Task 11: Machine comprehension using commonsense knowledge (2018) Proceedings of the 12Th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 747-757. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Palmer, M., Gildea, D., Kingsbury, P., The proposition bank: An annotated corpus of semantic roles (2005) Comput.

The main difference these texts have with news articles is that their target is apparently defined and unique across the text. Thence while dealing with news articles, we performed three subtasks namely identifying the target; separation of good and bad news content from the good and bad sentiment expressed on the target and analysis of clearly marked opinion that is expressed explicitly, not needing interpretation or the use of world knowledge. On concluding these tasks, we present our work on mining opinions about three different Indian political parties during elections in the year 2009. We built a Corpus of 689 opinion-rich instances from three different English dailies namely The Hindu, Times of India and Economic Times extracted from 02/ 01/ 2009 to 05/ 01/ 2009 (MM/ DD/ YY). In which (a) we tested the relative suitability of various sentiment analysis methods (both machine learning and lexical based) and (b) we attempted to separate positive or negative opinion from good or bad news. Evaluation includes comparison of three sentiment analysis methods (two machine learning based and one lexical based) and analyzing the choice of certain words used in political text which influence the Sentiments of public in polls. This preliminary experiment will benefit in predicting and forecasting the winning party in forthcoming Indian elections 2014. © 2014 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization.",News Articles; Public Mood; Sentiment Analysis,Machine learning; Reactor cores; Indian elections; News articles; News content; Political parties; Product reviews; Public mood; Two machines; World knowledge; Sentiment analysis,"Wiberg, M., The interaction society: Theories practice and supportive technologies (2004) Idea Group Inc; Wiebe, J., Tracking point of view in narrative (1994) Computational Linguistics, p. 20; Banfield, A., ZUnspeakable Sentences: Narration and Representation in the Language of Fiction, , Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1982; Quirk, R., (1985) A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language, , Longman Publishing House; Liu, B., Sentiment analysis and subjectivity (2010) Handbook of Natural Language Processing, , Second Edition; Esuli, A., Sebastiani, F., SentiWordNet: A publicly available resource for opinion mining (2006) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC 2006, , Italy; Hannak, A., Anderson, E., Barrett, L.F., Lehmann, S., Mislove, A., Riedewald, M., Tweetin'in the rain: Exploring societal-scale effects of weather on mood (2012) Int'l AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM); Pang, B., Lee, L., Vaithyanathan, S., Thumbs up sentiment classification using machine learning techniques (2002) ACL Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 79-86; Balahur, A., Steinberger, R., Rethinking sentiment analysis in the news: From theory to practice and back (2009) European Commission-Joint Research Centre, University of Alicante, Department of Software and Computing Systems.

Due to the complex features of the real-world tasks, current LSTM models become increasingly bigger and more complicated for enhancing the learning ability and prediction accuracy. However, through our in-depth characterization on the state-of-the-art general-purpose deep-learning accelerators, we observe that the LSTM training execution grows inefficient in terms of storage, performance, and energy consumption, under an increasing model size. With further algorithmic and architectural analysis, we identify the root cause for large LSTM training inefficiency: massive intermediate variables. To enable a highly-efficient LSTM training solution for the ever-growing model size, we exploit some unique memory-saving and performance improvement opportunities from the LSTM training procedure, and leverage them to propose the first cross-stack training solution, η-LSTM, for large LSTM models. η-LSTM comprises both software-level and hardware-level innovations that effectively lower the memory footprint upper-bound and excessive data movements during large LSTM training, while also drastically improving training performance and energy efficiency. Experimental results on six real-world large LSTM training benchmarks demonstrate that η-LSTM reduces the required memory footprint by an average of 57.5% (up to 75.8%) and brings down the data movements for weight matrices, activation data, and intermediate variables by 40.9%, 32.9%, and 80.0%, respectively. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art GPU implementation for LSTM training by an average of 3.99× (up to 5.73×) on performance and 2.75× (up to 4.25) on energy.

Research has shown that if affective computing technologies and machine learning mechanisms can be introduced to enhance interaction and feedback between ISRs and users, ISRs may be better aligned with both the service scenarios and the future development of innovative services. Based on an interdisciplinary integration framework, this study combined the concept and methodologies of design thinking, emotion detection technologies, and case-based reasoning (CBR), based on the use case of a simulated interview for empirical research, and developed a prototype emotion-sensing robot (ESR) system for the planning and testing of emotion sensing. Three emotion detection and analysis indicators, namely, happiness index of facial expressions, blink rate, and semantic emotions conveyed by the text on their resume, were proposed as the basis for analyzing emotional perception in this study. The experimental results were then used to analyze the effectiveness of the technologies as well as the value, utility, and affordance of the interactive interview bot system. © 2020 ACM.",c-b reasoning; design thinking; Emotion-sensing robot; machining learning; user-centered design,Behavioral research; Integration testing; Machine design; Robot programming; Robots; Semantics; Affective Computing; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Design and technology; Empirical research; Facial Expressions; Integration frameworks; Interactive services; Machine learning mechanism; Case based reasoning,"Zuckerman, O., Hoffman, G., (2015) Empathy Objects: Robotic Devices As Conversation Companions, the Ninth International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction, Stanford, pp. 593-598; Sun, B., Liu, Y.-N., Chen, J.-B., Luo, J.-H., Zhang, D., Emotion analysis based on facial expressions in the intelligent learning environment (2015) Modern Distance Education Research, (2), pp. 96-103. , Mar., 2015; Sarosa, M., Junus, M., Ulfah Hoesny, M., Classification Technique of Interviewer-Bot Result using Naïve Bayes and Phrase Reinforcement Algorithms (2018) International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning, 13 (2), pp. 33-47. , 2018; Caic, M., Odekerken-Schröder, G., Mahr, D., Service robots: Value co-creation and co-destruction in elderly care networks (2018) Journal of Service Management, 29 (2), pp. 178-205",,Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ),ICST,"2020 Symposium on Emerging Research from Asia and on Asian Contexts and Cultures, AsianCHI 2020 - Part of CHI 2020",25 April 2020,,162057,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091395778

This is a non-trivial task that involves common-sense reasoning. However, existing efforts rely on hand-crafted features to extract the workflow graph from recipes due to the lack of large-scale labeled datasets. Moreover, they fail to utilize the cooking images, which constitute an important part of food recipes. In this paper, we build MM-ReS, the first large-scale dataset for cooking workflow construction, consisting of 9,850 recipes with human-labeled workflow graphs. Cooking steps are multi-modal, featuring both text instructions and cooking images. We then propose a neural encoder-decoder model that utilizes both visual and textual information to construct the cooking workflow, which achieved over 20% performance gain over existing hand-crafted baselines. © 2020 ACM.",cause-and-effect reasoning; cooking workflow; deep learning; food recipes; mm-res dataset; multi-modal fusion,Large dataset; Commonsense reasoning; Encoder-decoder; Labeled datasets; Large-scale dataset; Non-trivial tasks; Performance Gain; Text instruction; Textual information; Cooking,"Bossard, L., Guillaumin, M., Van Gool, L., Food-101-Mining discriminative components with random forests (2014) Proceedings of ECCV, 8694, pp. 446-461; Carvalho, M., Cadène, R., Picard, D., Soulier, L., Thome, N., Cord, M., Cross-modal retrieval in the cooking context: Learning semantic text-image embeddings (2018) Proceedings of SIGIR., pp. 35-44; Carvalho, M., Cadène, R., Picard, D., Soulier, L., Thome, N., Cord, M., Cross-modal retrieval in the cooking context: Learning semantic text-image embeddings (2018) Proceedings of SIGIR., pp. 35-44; Chen, J., Pan, L., Wei, Z., Wang, X., Ngo, C.-W., Chua, T.-S., Zero-shot ingredient recognition by multi-relational graph convolutional network (2020) Proceedings of AAAI., pp. 10542-10550; Chen, J.-J., Ngo, C.-W., Chua, T.-S., Cross-modal recipe retrieval with rich food attributes (2017) Proceedings of ACM-MM., pp. 1771-1779; Chen, J.-J., Pan, L., Wei, Z., Wang, X., Ngo, C.-W., Chua, T.-S., Zero-shot ingredient recognition by multi-relational graph convolutional network (2017) Proceedings of AAAI.; Chung, J., Ahn, S., Bengio, Y., Hierarchical multiscale recurrent neural networks (2017) Proceedings of ICLR.; Devlin, J., Chang, M.-W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding (2019) Proceedings of NAACL-HLT., pp. 4171-4186; Gordon, J., Zhu, L., Galstyan, A., Natarajan, P., Burns, G., Modeling concept dependencies in a scientific corpus (2016) Proceedings of ACL, 1, pp. 866-875; Hamada, R., Okabe, J., Ide, I., Satoh, S., Sakai, S., Tanaka, H., Cooking navi: Assistant for daily cooking in kitchen (2005) Proceedings of ACM-MM., pp. 371-374; Harashima, J., Someya, Y., Kikuta, Y., Cookpad image dataset: An image collection as infrastructure for food research (2017) Proceedings of SIGIR., pp. 1229-1232; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Deep residual learning for image recognition (2016) Proceedings of CVPR., pp. 770-778; Herranz, L., Jiang, S., Xu, R., Modeling restaurant context for food recognition (2017) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM), 19 (2), pp. 430-440. , 2017; Hochreiter, S., Schmidhuber, J., Long short-term memory (1997) Neural Computation, 9 (8), pp. 1735-1780. , 1997; Horiguchi, S., Amano, S., Ogawa, M., Aizawa, K., Personalized classifier for food image recognition (2018) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM), 20 (10), pp. 2836-2848. , 2018; Jermsurawong, J., Habash, N., Predicting the structure of cooking recipes (2015) Proceedings of EMNLP., pp. 781-786; Karikome, S., Fujii, A., Improving structural analysis of cooking recipe text (2012) IEICE Technical Report.

As software developers are moving from big upfront design to an evolutionary or emerging design, the architecture of a system evolves as more functionality is added. In agile software development, functional user requirements are often expressed as user stories. Quality attributes might be implicitly referenced in user stories. To support a more systematic analysis and reasoning about quality attributes in agile development projects, this paper explores how to automatically identify quality attributes from user stories. This could help better understand relevant quality attributes (and potential architectural key drivers) before analysing product backlogs and domains in detail and provides the 'bigger picture' of potential architectural drivers for early architecture decision making. The goal of this paper is to present our vision and preliminary work towards understanding whether user stories do include information about quality attributes at all, and if so, how we can identify such information in an automated manner. © 2019 IEEE.",agile software development; decision making; machine learning; natural language processing; software architecture,C (programming language); Computer architecture; Computer software selection and evaluation; Decision making; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Software architecture; Agile software development; Architectural drivers; Architecture decisions; NAtural language processing; Software architecture design; Software developer; Software quality attributes; Systematic analysis; Software design,"Bass, L., Klein, M., Bachmann, F., Quality attribute design primitives and the attribute driven design method (2002) Software Product-Family Engineering, pp. 169-186. , F. van der Linden, Ed.

In particular, the recently proposed attention models (Rocktäschel et al., 2015; Wang and Jiang, 2015) achieves state-of-the-art accuracy by computing soft word alignments between the premise and hypothesis sentences. However, there remains a major limitation: this line of work completely ignores syntax and recursion, which is helpful in many traditional efforts. We show that it is beneficial to extend the attention model to tree nodes between premise and hypothesis. More importantly, this subtree-level attention reveals information about entailment relation. We study the recursive composition of this subtree-level entailment relation, which can be viewed as a soft version of the Natural Logic framework (MacCartney and Manning, 2009). Experiments show that our structured attention and entailment composition model can correctly identify and infer entailment relations from the bottom up, and bring significant improvements in accuracy. © 1963-2018 ACL.",,Computational linguistics; Text processing; Attention model; Composition model; Discrete models; Learning techniques; Natural logic; State of the art; Textual entailment; Word alignment; Deep learning,"Ba, J., Salakhutdinov, R.R., Grosse, R.B., Frey, B.J., Learning wake-sleep recurrent attention models (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2575-2583; Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., (2014) Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate; Bowman, S.R., Angeli, G., Potts, C., Manning, C.D., A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 632-642. , Lisbon, Portugal, September.

In our setting we use depth-sensor data obtained from a simulator and use inductive logic programming (ILP), a subfield of machine learning that deals with learning concept descriptions, to learn how to detect borders, find the border that is nearest to some point of interest, and border correspondence through time. We demonstrate how ILP can be used to tackle this problem in an incremental manner by using previously learned predicates to construct more complex ones. The learned concept descriptions show high (> 90%) accuracy and their natural language interpretation closely matches an intuitive understanding of their meaning. © 2015 IEEE.",assistive devices; context awareness; Knowlegde discovery; supervised learning,Artificial intelligence; Computer circuits; Data visualization; Inductive sensors; Learning systems; Reconfigurable hardware; Supervised learning; Assistive devices; Concept description; Context- awareness; Intuitive understanding; Knowlegde discovery; Outdoor environment; Point of interest; Visually impaired; Inductive logic programming (ILP),"Azenkot, S., Ladner, R.E., Wobbrock, J.O., Smartphone haptic feedback for nonvisual wayfinding (2011) Proceedings of the 13th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility, pp. 281-282; Bain, M., Muggleton, S., Non-monotonic learning (1992) Inductive Logic Programming, pp. 145-161. , In S Muggleton, editor Academic Press; Borenstein, J., Everett, H.R., Feng, L., Wehe, D., Mobile robot positioning sensors and techniques (1997) Journal of Robotic Systems, 14 (4), pp. 231-249; Bratko, I., Muggleton, S., Varsek, A., Learning qualitative models of dynamic systems (1991) Proceedings of the Eighth International Workshop (ML91), pp. 385-388. , In Lawrence Birnbaum and Gregg Collins Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, USA Morgan Kaufmann; Croce, D., Gallo, P., Garlisi, D., Giarre, L., Mangione, S., Tinnirello, I.I., ARIANNA: A smartphone-based navigation system with human in the loop (2014) Proceedings of the 22nd Mediterranean Conference of Control and Automation (MED, pp. 8-13; Ghantous, M., Nahas, M., Ghamloush, M., Rida, M., ISee: An android application for the assistance of the visually impaired (2014) Advance Machine Learning Technologies and Applications, pp. 26-35; Guerrero, L.A., Vasquez, F., Ochoa, S.F., An indoor navigation system for the visually impaired (2012) Sensors, 12 (6), pp. 8236-8258; Hakobyan, L., Mobile Assistive Technologies for the Visually Impaired (2013) Survey of Ophtalmology, 58 (6), pp. 513-528; Hirst, J.D., King, R.D., Sternberg, M.J.E., Quantitative structure-activity relationships by neural networks and inductive logic programming.

Focusing on big data in industrial and operation management, the value of textual data is oftentimes undermined. Optimal use of data reinforces the integrative modeling and analysis of RAM (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability). Data-driven reliability engineering and maintenance management, gains benefit from textual data, especially for identifying unknown failure modes and causes, and solving problems. The scientific challenge is how to effectively discover knowledge from text data and convert it into automated processes for inferential reasoning, predicting and prescribing. This paper outlines how the reliability-centered maintenance in production systems can be improved by explicating and discovering human-specific knowledge from maintenance reports and related textual documents. Hence, a theoretical model for text understanding is proposed, which is demonstrated as a proof-of-concept demonstrator using real world manufacturing datasets. The text understanding model is represented by a three-dimensional matrix comprising three indexes, i.e. text readability, word associations within texts as well as sentiment. The implementation of the model as a software prototype involves using text mining techniques and machine learning algorithms. This paper emphasizes on the importance of knowledge extraction from text in the context of industrial maintenance, by demonstrating how an increased value of text understandability of maintenance reports correlates to an early stage detection of failure, the reduction of human failures and leads to an immense improvement of explication of human knowledge. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Human failure; Industry 4.0; Maintenance; Reliability; Text mining,Automation; Data handling; Industrial management; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Maintenance; Manufacture; Reliability analysis; Software prototyping; Industrial maintenance; Knowledge extraction; Maintenance management; Manufacturing enterprise; Reliability centered maintenance; Reliability engineering; Text mining techniques; Three dimensional matrices; Text mining,"Zhang, D., Zhang, Y., Yu, M., Chen, Y., Reliability evaluation and component importance measure for manufacturing systems based on failure losses (2015) J.

Hence, it has become essential to structure an efficient algorithm for analysing sentiments from text. Even though traditional machine learning algorithms were a breakthrough in the domain, there remained a demand for a better solution. This paper presents a systematic & qualitative literature review for various approaches to sentiment analysis using hybridized soft-computing techniques to cater to noise and improve the flexibility of a fuzzy inference-based sentiment analysis system. This qualitative literature review adds to the body of evidence that soft-computing and fuzzy logic techniques can be effectively applied to a range of applications where noise is inherent, especially in the case of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. © 2021 IEEE",Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Fuzzy logic; Genetic algorithms; Sentiment analysis,Cloud computing; Data mining; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Soft computing; Analysis techniques; Fuzzy logic techniques; Literature reviews; Opinion mining; Soft computing approaches; Softcomputing techniques; Sentiment analysis,"Liu, B., (2012) Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining, , Morgan &Claypool; Wollmer, M., Weninger, F., Knaup, T., Schuller, B., Congkai, S., Sagae, K., Morency, L., Youtube movie reviews: Sentiment analysis in an audio-visual context (2013) IEEE Intell.

Motivated by Michal-ski's [29] seminal approach to the comprehensiveness of data mining and machine learning results, with a clear emphasis on natural language, we advocate the use of linguistic summaries which provide a new quality and an exceptional human consistency and comprehensiveness. Extending our previous works, we first relate our approach to some related results on the interpretability and comprehensiveness of fuzzy rule bases, both with respect to structural and semantical complexity. We show the use of a fuzzy querying interface as not only an approach that is effective and efficient but which provides an exceptional comprehensiveness through its highly human consistent HCI (human computer interface). We emphasize a psychological and cognitive aspect of comprehensibility and interpretability analyses. We advocate the use of human consistent methods based on natural language. We indicate a possibility of using quantitative evaluations. We illustrate our analysis by two examples related to the linguistic summarization of both static and dynamic data in the area of innovation and Web log analyses, and justify the results obtained by domain experts positive assessments. In general, we propose a synergistic combination of formal and natural language based methods to solve the inherently human specific problem of comprehensiveness and interpretability. © 2013 IEEE.",Comprehensiveness interpretability; fuzzy logic; fuzzy rules; linguistic summaries,Cognitive aspects; Human computer interfaces; Interpretability; Linguistic summaries; Linguistic summarization; Quantitative evaluation; Specific problems; Synergistic combinations; Artificial intelligence; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy rules; Human computer interaction; Natural language processing systems; Linguistics,"Alonso, J.M., Magdalena, L., Guillaume, S., HILK: A new methodology for designing highly interpretable linguistic knowledge bases using the fuzzy logic formalism (2008) International Journal of Intelligent Systems, 23, pp. 761-794; Alonso, J.M., Magdalena, L., Rodrguez, G., Looking for a good fuzzy system interpretability index: An experimental approach (2009) International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 51, pp. 115-134; Mencar, C., Fanelli, A., Interpretability constraints for fuzzy information granulation (2008) Information Sciences, 178, p. 45854618; Mencar, C., Castiello, C., Cannone, R., Fanelli, A.M., Interpretability assessment of fuzzy knowledge bases: A cointension based approach (2011) International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 52 (4), pp. 501-518; Mikut, R., Jakel, J., Gröll, L., Interpretability issues in data-based learning of fuzzy systems (2005) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 150, pp. 179-197; Zhou, S.M., Gan, J.Q., Low-level interpretability and high-level interpretability: A unified view of data-driven interpretable fuzzy system modelling (2008) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 159, pp. 3091-3131; Gacto, M.J., Alcalá, R., Herrera, F., Interpretability of linguistic fuzzy rule-based systems: An overview of interpretability measures (2011) Information Sciences, 181, pp. 4340-4360; Baczko, T., Kacprzyk, J., Zadrozny, S., Towards knowledge driven individual integrated indicators of innovativeness (2011) Knowledge-Based Intelligent System Advancements: Systemic and Cybernetic Approaches, pp. 129-140. , In: Jozefczyk J and Orski D (eds. ).

Motivated by the recent successes of embeddings in natural language processing, researchers have tried to find network embeddings in order to exploit machine learning algorithms for mining tasks like node classification and edge prediction. However, most of the work focuses on distributed representations of nodes that are inherently ill-suited to tasks such as community detection which are intuitively dependent on subgraphs. Here, we formulate subgraph embedding problem based on two intuitive properties of subgraphs and propose Sub2Vec, an unsupervised algorithm to learn feature representations of arbitrary subgraphs. We also highlight the usability of Sub2Vec by leveraging it for network mining tasks, like community detection and graph classification. We show that Sub2Vec gets significant gains over state-of-the-art methods. In particular, Sub2Vec offers an approach to generate a richer vocabulary of meaningful features of subgraphs for representation and reasoning. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",,Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Population dynamics; Community detection; Distributed representation; Embedding problems; Feature learning; Feature representation; Graph classification; State-of-the-art methods; Unsupervised algorithms; Data mining,"Bach, F.R., Jordan, M.I., Learning spectral clustering (2003) NIPS, 16; Belkin, M., Niyogi, P., Laplacian eigenmaps and spectral techniques for embedding and clustering (2001) NIPS, 14, pp. 585-591; Bhagat, S., Cormode, G., Muthukrishnan, S., Node classification in social networks (2011) Social Network Data Analytics, pp. 115-148. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-8462-3_5, Aggarwal, C.

Current sentiment analysis methods are mainly based on the hypothesis that each word expresses only one sentiment. However, human sentiment are prototyped and fuzzy-confined as declared in social psychology, which is conflicting with the hypothesis. This is one of the barriers that impede the computation of complex public sentiment of web events in microblog. Therefore, how to find a reasonable computational model, combining learning technology and human sentiment cognition theory, is a novel idea in event sentiment analysis of microblog. In this paper, a new sentiment computation approach, which is defined as public sentiments discriminator (PSD), considering both fuzzy logic and sentiment complexity, is proposed. Unlike traditional machine learning methods, PSD is based on the rational hypothesis that sentiments are correlated with each other. A three-level computing structure, sentiment-term level, microblog level and public sentiment level, is employed. Experiments show that the proposed approach, PSD, can achieve similar accuracy and F1-measure but more cognitive results when compared with traditional well-known machine learning methods. These experimental studies have confirmed that PSD can generate an interpretable result with no restriction among sentiments. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Fuzzy sentiment analysis; human sentiment cognition; microblog; public sentiment,Artificial intelligence; Computer circuits; Data mining; Learning systems; Computational model; Fuzzy sentiment analysis; human sentiment cognition; Learning technology; Machine learning methods; Micro-blog; Public sentiments; Sentiment analysis; Fuzzy logic,"Zhu, Y., An integrated method for micro-blog subjective sentence identification based on three-way decisions and naive Bayes (2014) Rough Sets and Knowledge Technology, pp. 844-855. , Springer International Publishing; Pang, B., Lee, L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2008) Found.

In particular, recent advances in image captioning use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to alleviate the “exposure bias” during training: ground-truth subsequence is exposed in every step prediction, which introduces bias in test when only predicted subsequence is seen. However, existing RL-based image captioning methods only focus on the language policy while not the visual policy (e.g., visual attention), and thus fail to capture the visual context that are crucial for compositional reasoning such as visual relationships (e.g., “man riding horse”) and comparisons (e.g., “smaller cat”). To fill the gap, we propose a Context-Aware Visual Policy network (CAVP) for sequence-level image captioning. At every time step, CAVP explicitly accounts for the previous visual attentions as the context, and then decides whether the context is helpful for the current word generation given the current visual attention. Compared against traditional visual attention that only fixes a single image region at every step, CAVP can attend to complex visual compositions over time. The whole image captioning model - CAVP and its subsequent language policy network - can be efficiently optimized end-to-end by using an actor-critic policy gradient method with respect to any caption evaluation metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CAVP by state-of-the-art performances on MS-COCO offline split and online server, using various metrics and sensible visualizations of qualitative visual context. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Behavioral research;

Those are achievement results in the world. At the same time, it is used in various applications and research fields. This technology is expected for using embedded systems of IoT devices such as smartphones and tablet-pc. This technology is expected for using the embedded system of IoT devices such as smartphones and tablet-pc. Deep-learning requires large computational resources and high power consumption. GPU is a kind of solution to computational resources. In general, most systems need to use GPU acceleration. However, it is a hard point to implement on tiny embedded devices under the required GPU. Also, in recent years, FPGAs have been applied to image processing technology fields such as defect inspection of automobiles, security systems, and industrial products. Hardware acceleration is one of the techniques to improve processing speed. This technique is often used in the field of image processing. Our research tried to design the hardware acceleration approach for the convolutional neural network and we compared the software processing approach and our hardware approach. The software processing approach is conventional. As a result, our hardware-based convolutional layer can show high-speed performance than the software-based design. These hardware-based modules were implemented on FPGA. We used HDL(Hardware Description Language) to implement on FPGA. By using this, you can create a logic circuit like programming. It is usually used when designing the FPGA circuit. In this paper, we show the detail of the architecture and the comparison result of processing time with CPU. © 2020 IEEE.",Convolutional Neural Network; FPGA; Pipeline,Computation theory; Computer circuits;

Cramming education will no longer exist, and students have to learn more than memorizing. Secondly, artificial intelligence can provide a variety of effective learning methods, not only students can record learning content, but also make learning more effective. Teachers can also analyze the students’ learning and get feedback from the students so that they can learn from each other. STEAM education is increasingly valued by many countries, such as the ITEEA’s Education by Design, 6E Learning by DeSIGN STEM courses, and NASA-sponsored robot STEAM courses. South Korea have further promoted STEAM education (such as Incheon University) to propose the Wheel Model (STEAM & HUG). STEAM’s goals combining with design thinking, cross-domain learning, and teamwork form the main spirits of Taiwan’s 12-year national curriculum, which are “taking the initiative, engaging the public, and seeking the common good”. Those main components of artificial intelligence are knowledge reasoning, planning, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Artificial intelligence becomes an important learning and educational tool for students. Meanwhile, students learn through artificial intelligence products. Based on artificial intelligence components and STEAM education, how to develop instruction model and learning modules will be a most important theme. Through effectiveness artificial intelligence STEAM instruction, students’ higher-order thinking ability, creativity, problem solving ability, and the literacy of artificial intelligence will be improved effectively. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.",Artificial intelligence; STEAM; Teaching effectiveness,Computer vision; Curricula; Education computing; Educational robots; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine design; NASA; Natural language processing systems; Problem solving; Robot programming; Steam; Cross-domain learning; Educational tools; Effective learning; Higher-order thinkings; Knowledge reasoning; Learning contents; NAtural language processing; Problem-solving abilities; Students,"(2019) Taiwan AI Action Plan-Mastering the opportunity to fully launch the industry’s AI, , https://www.ey.gov.tw/Page/5A8A0CB5B41DA11E/a8ec407c-6154-4c14-8f1e-d494ec2dbf23, Executive Yuan News and Communications Office; (2017) Using artificial intelligence education to enhance students’ competitiveness and creativity, , https://www.ey.gov.tw/Page/9277F759E41CCD91/70882f5c-5b3f-4a4e-8ff5-5ec1148ef830, Executive Yuan News and Communications Office; Helmstaedter, M., The mutual inspirations of machine learning and neuroscience (2015) Neuron, 86 (1), pp. 25-28; Kim, P.W., The wheel model of STEAM education based on traditional Korean scientific contents (2016) Eurasia J.

Though there have been a variety of models for knowledge graph embedding, most methods merely concentrate on the fact triples, while supplementary textual descriptions of entities and relations have not been fully employed. To this end, this paper proposes the semantic space projection (SSP) model which jointly learns from the symbolic triples and textual descriptions. Our model builds interaction between the two information sources, and employs textual descriptions to discover semantic relevance and offer precise semantic embedding. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves substantial improvements against baselines on the tasks of knowledge graph completion and entity classification.

AKEOS can automatically harvest knowledge from online resources to build a Bayesian network inference engine. Starting from a single event, the AKEOS system performs unsupervised knowledge extraction to convert unstructured text into structured knowledge. By performing repeated knowledge extraction for multiple similar events, AKEOS produces structured databases. Thus, various machine learning algorithms can be directly applied to explore relations between attributes, to discover patterns hidden in the data, or to build inference engines such as Bayesian networks for predictive and diagnostic reasoning. AKEOS is an end-to-end system with lists of events as input, structured databases as intermediate products, and inference engines as end products. © 2016 ISIF.",,Artificial intelligence; Engines; Extraction; Inference engines; Information fusion; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Bayesian Network inference; Diagnostic reasoning; End-to-end systems; Intermediate product; Knowledge extraction; Structured database; Structured knowledge; Unstructured texts; Bayesian networks,"Gangemi, A., A comparison of knowledge extraction tools for the semantic web (2013) The Semantic Web: Semantics and Big Data, pp. 351-366. , Springer; Alani, H., Kim, S., Millard, D.E., Weal, M.J., Hall, W., Lewis, P.H., Shadbolt, N.R., Automatic ontology-based knowledge extraction from web documents (2003) Intelligent Systems, IEEE, 18 (1), pp. 14-21; Singhal, A., Introducing the knowledge graph: Things, not strings (2012) Official Google Blog, , May; Etzioni, O., Cafarella, M., Downey, D., Popescu, A.-M., Shaked, T., Soderland, S., Weld, D.S., Yates, A., Unsupervised named-entity extraction from the web: An experimental study (2005) Artificial Intelligence, 165 (1), pp. 91-134; Etzioni, O., Banko, M., Soderland, S., Weld, D.S., Open information extraction from the web (2008) Communications of the ACM, 51 (12), pp. 68-74; Kasneci, G., Van Gael, J., Herbrich, R., Graepel, T., Bayesian knowledge corroboration with logical rules and user feedback (2010) Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, pp. 1-18. , Springer; http//esw.w3.org/topic/SweoIG/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData, W3C SweoIG: The linking open data community project; http//www.wolframalpha.com/, Wolfram Alpha: A Computational Knowledge Engine; http//entitycube.research.microsoft.com/, Entitycube; http//www.trueknowledge.com/, True knowledge; Kasneci, G., Gael, J.V., Stern, D., Graepel, T., Cobayes: Bayesian knowledge corroboration with assessors of unknown areas of expertise (2011) Proceedings of the Fourth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, pp. 465-474. , ACM; Mimno, D., Wallach, H.M., Talley, E., Leenders, M., McCallum, A., Optimizing semantic coherence in topic models (2011) Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

Five steps compose the Semantic HMC process: Indexation, Vectorization, Hierarchization, Resolution and Realization. The first three steps construct automatically the label hierarchy from data sources. The last two steps classify new items according to the label hierarchy. This paper focuses in the last two steps and presents a new highly scalable process to classify items from huge sets of unstructured text by using ontologies and rule-based reasoning. The process is implemented in a scalable and distributed platform to process Big Data and some results are discussed. © 2016 ACM.",Big-Data; Classification; Machine learning; Ontology,Classification (of information); Learning systems; Ontology; Semantics; Distributed platforms; Hierarchical multi-label classifications; Hierarchization; Large datasets; Ontologies and rules; Unstructured texts; Unsupervised classification; Very large datum; Big data,"Ben-David, D., Enterprise data classification using semantic web technologies (2010) 9th International Semantic Web Conference - Volume Part II, pp. 66-81. , (2010); Bi, W., Kwok, J., Multi-label classification on treeand DAG-structured hierarchies (2011) Yeast, pp. 1-8. , (2011); Chen, M., Big data: A survey (2014) Mobile Networks and Applications, 19 (2), pp. 171-209. , (Jan. 2014); Dean, J., Ghemawat, S., MapReduce: Simplified data processing on large clusters (2008) Communications of the ACM, 51 (1), pp. 1-13. , (2008); Elberrichi, Z., (2012) Medical Documents Classification Based on the Domain Ontology MeSH, , arXiv preprint (2012); Fang, J., Documents classification by using ontology reasoning and similarity measure (2010) Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD), 2010 Seventh International Conference On, pp. 1535-1539. , 2010; De Farias, T., FOWLA, A federated architecture for ontologies (2015) RuleML 2015, LNCS 9202, pp. 97-111. , (2015); Fensel, D., (2001) Ontologies: Silver Bullet for Knowledge Management and Electronic Commerce, , Springer-Verlag; Galinina, A., Borisov, A., Knowledge modelling for ontology-based multiattribute classification system (2013) Applied Information and Communication, pp. 103-109. , (2013); Hassan, T., Semantic HMC for big data analysis (2014) BigData (BigData), 2014 IEEE International Conference On, pp. 26-28. , (2014); Hitzler, P., Janowicz, K., Linked data, big data, and the 4th paradigm (2013) Semantic Web, 4 (2013), pp. 233-235; Horst, H.J., Completeness, decidability and complexity of entailment for RDF schema and a semantic extension involving the OWL vocabulary (2005) Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web, pp. 79-115. , (2005); Johnson, I., Making ontology-based knowledge and decision trees interact: An approach to enrich knowledge and increase expert confidence in data-driven models (2010) Knowledge Science, Engineering and Management, pp. 304-316; Kalyanpur, A., Pellet: A practical OWL-DL reasoner (2007) Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web; Möller, R., Haarslev, V., (2009) Tableau-based Reasoning; Motik, B., (2009) Hypertableau Reasoning for Description Logics, 36 (2009), pp. 165-228; Motik, B., Sattler, U., (2006) A Comparison of Reasoning Techniques for Querying Large Description Logic ABoxes, pp. 227-241. , (2006); Obrst, L., Ontologies for semantically interoperable systems (2003) Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management - CIKM '03, pp. 366-369. , (2003); Peixoto, R., Semantic HMC: A predictive model using multi-label classification for big data (2015) The 9th IEEE International Conference on Big Data Science and Engineering (IEEE BigDataSE-15), , (2015); Syed, A., The future revolution on big data (2013) Future, 2 (6), pp. 2446-2451. , (2013); Tsarkov, D., Horrocks, I., FaCT++ description logic reasoner: System description (2006) Proceedings of the Third International Joint Conference, pp. 292-297. , (2006); Urbani, J., OWL reasoning with WebPIE: Calculating the closure of 100 billion triples (2010) The Semantic Web: Research and Applications, pp. 213-227. , Springer; Urbani, J., QueryPIE: Backward reasoning for OWL horst over very large knowledge bases (2011) Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on the Semantic Web-Volume Part I, pp. 730-745. , (Berlin, Heidelberg, 2011); Urbani, J., Three laws learned from web-scale reasoning (2013) 2013 AAAI Fall Symposium Series, , (2013); Urbani, J., WebPIE: A web-scale parallel inference engine using MapReduce (2012) Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web, pp. 59-75. , (2012); Vogrincic, S., Bosnic, Z., Ontology-based multi-label classification of economic articles (2011) Comput.

Most models in Decision support systems are assuming criteria as independent. Therefore, these models are ranking alternatives based on objective data analysis. Also, different type of data (time series, linguistic values, interval data, etc.) imposes some difficulties to do decision making using classical multi criteria decision making models. Sophisticated machine learning methods to estimate or extract emotions from the content created by users has been developed including support vector machines, Bayesian networks, maximum entropy approaches and concept level analysis of natural language text, supported by combinations of common-sense reasoning. These approaches are mainly based on language text processing with sufficient documents, which is usually inlarge is not available. We think Subjectiveness is related to the contextual form of criteria. Uncertainty of some criteria in decision making is also considered as other important aspect These draw backs in decision making are major research challenges that are attracting wide attention, like on big data analysis for risk prediction, medical diagnosis and other applications that are in practice more subjective to user situation and its knowledge related context. Subjectivity would be examined based on correlations between different contextual structures that is reflecting the framework of personal context, for example in nearest neighbor based correlation analysis fashion. Some of the attributes incompleteness also may lead to affect the approximation accuracy. Attributes with preference-ordered domain relations properties become one aspect in ordering properties in rough approximations. The Virtual Doctor System (VDS) developed by my group is a system assisting human doctor who is practicing medical diagnosis in real situation and environment. The interoperability is represented by utilizing the medical diagnosis cases of medical doctor, represented in machine executable fashion based on human patient interaction with virtual avatar resembling a real doctor. VDS is practiced as a virtual avatar interacting with the human patient based on physical views and mental view analysis. In this talk I outline our VDS system and then discuss related issues in subjective decision making in medical domain. Using fuzzy reasoning techniques in VDS, it has been shown that it is possible to provide better precision in circumstances that is related to partial known data and uncertainty on the acquisition of medical symptoms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Big data; Data handling; Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Information analysis; Learning systems; Maximum entropy methods; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Text processing; Uncertainty analysis; Virtual reality; Approximation accuracy; Commonsense reasoning; Correlation analysis; Maximum-entropy approaches; Multi-criteria decision-making models; Natural language text; Rough approximations; Sophisticated machines; Decision making,,"Fujita, H.; Intelligent Software Systems, Japan; email: HFujita-799@acm.org",,Springer Verlag,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Advances in Information and Communication Technology, ICTA 2016",12 December 2016 through 13 December 2016,,187819,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009509164

Originally mainly for computer scientists and engineers, it has been expanding its horizons and empowering many other disciplines contributing to the development of many novel applications in many sectors. These include medicine and health care, business and finance, psychology and neuroscience, physics and biology to mention a few. However, one of the disciplines in which artificial intelligence has not been fully explored and exploited yet is education. In this discipline, many research methods are employed by scholars, lecturers and practitioners to investigate the impact of different instructional approaches on learning and to understand the ways skills and knowledge are acquired by learners. One of these is qualitative research, a scientific method grounded in observations that manipulates and analyses non-numerical data. It focuses on seeking answers to why and how a particular observed phenomenon occurs rather than on its occurrences. This study aims to explore and discuss the impact of artificial intelligence on qualitative research methods. In particular, it focuses on how artificial intelligence have empowered qualitative research methods so far, and how it can be used in education for enhancing teaching and learning. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial intelligence; Automated reasoning; Behaviourism; Cognitivism; Constructivism; Data analysis; Education; Knowledge representation; Learning; Machine learning; Methods; Natural language processing; Perception; Planning; Qualitative research; Teaching,Artificial intelligence; Data reduction; Education; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Numerical methods; Planning; Sensory perception; Teaching; Automated reasoning; Behaviourism; Cognitivism; Constructivism; Learning; Methods; NAtural language processing; Qualitative research; Learning systems,"Arora, S., Ge, R., Halpern, Y., Mimno, D., Moitra, A., Sontag, D., Wu, Y., Zhu, M., A practical algorithm for topic modeling with provable guarantees (2013) International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 280-288. , pp; Auerbach, C., Silverstein, L.B., (2003) Qualitative Data: An Introduction to Coding and Analysis, , NYU Press, New York; Bahrammirzaee, A., A comparative survey of artificial intelligence applications in finance: artificial neural networks, expert system and hybrid intelligent systems (2010) Neural Comput.

As an effect, in line with recent advances in machine learning research, software maintenance activities are switching from symbolic formal methods to data-driven methods. In this context, the rich semantics hidden in source code identifiers provide opportunities for building semantic representations of code which can assist tasks of code search and reuse. To this end, we deliver in the form of pretrained vector space models, distributed code representations for six popular programming languages, namely, Java, Python, PHP, C, C++, and C#. The models are produced using fastText, a state-of-the-art library for learning word representations. Each model is trained on data from a single programming language; the code mined for producing all models amounts to over 13.000 repositories. We indicate dissimilarities between natural language and source code, as well as variations in coding conventions in between the different programming languages we processed. We describe how these heterogeneities guided the data preprocessing decisions we took and the selection of the training parameters in the released models. Finally, we propose potential applications of the models and discuss limitations of the models. © 2019 IEEE.",Code Semantics; Fasttext; Semantic Similarity; Vector Space Models,Codes (symbols); Formal methods; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Object oriented programming; Open source software; Open systems; Semantics; Software design; Vector spaces; Code semantics; Distributed code representations; Fasttext; Machine learning research; Open source repositories; Semantic similarity; Software maintenance activity; Vector space models; C++ (programming language),"Allamanis, M., Barr, E.T., Devanbu, P., Sutton, C., A survey of machine learning for big code and naturalness (2018) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 51 (4), p. 81; Hindle, A., Barr, E.T., Su, Z., Gabel, M., Devanbu, P., On the naturalness of software (2012) Software Engineering (ICSE), 2012 34th International Conference on, , IEEE; Ernst, M.D., Natural language is a programming language: Applying natural language processing to software development (2017) LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics, 71. , Schloss Dagstuhl-Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik; White, M., Tufano, M., Vendome, C., Poshyvanyk, D., Deep learning code fragments for code clone detection (2016) Proceedings of the 31st IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, , ACM; Wei, H., Li, M., Supervised deep features for software functional clone detection by exploiting lexical and syntactical information in source code (2017) IJCAI; Vasilescu, B., Casalnuovo, C., Devanbu, P., Recovering clear, natural identifiers from obfuscated js names (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 11th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering, pp. 683-693. , ACM; Nguyen, A.T., Nguyen, T.T., Nguyen, T.N., Lexical statistical machine translation for language migration (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 9th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering, , ACM; Iyer, S., Konstas, I., Cheung, A., Zettlemoyer, L., Summarizing source code using a neural attention model (2016) Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1, pp. 2073-2083; Allamanis, M., Peng, H., Sutton, C., A convolutional attention network for extreme summarization of source code (2016) International Conference on Machine Learning; Pu, Y., Narasimhan, K., Solar-Lezama, A., Barzilay, R., Sk p: A neural program corrector for moocs (2016) Companion Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity, , ACM; Gupta, R., Pal, S., Kanade, A., Shevade, S., Deepfix: Fixing common c language errors by deep learning (2017) AAAI; Foster, S.R., Griswold, W.G., Lerner, S., Witchdoctor: Ide support for real-time auto-completion of refactorings (2012) Software Engineering (ICSE), 2012 34th International Conference on, , IEEE; Oda, Y., Fudaba, H., Neubig, G., Hata, H., Sakti, S., Toda, T., Nakamura, S., Learning to generate pseudo-code from source code using statistical machine translation (t) (2015) Automated Software Engineering (ASE), 2015 30th IEEE/ACM International Conference on, , IEEE; Ling, W., Blunsom, P., Grefenstette, E., Hermann, K.M., Kocisky, T., Wang, F., Senior, A., Latent predictor networks for code generation (2016) Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1; Yin, P., Neubig, G., A syntactic neural model for general-purpose code generation (2017) Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1; Alexandru, C.V., Panichella, S., Gall, H.C., Replicating parser behavior using neural machine translation (2017) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Program Comprehension, , IEEE Press; Allamanis, M., Sutton, C., Mining source code repositories at massive scale using language modeling (2013) Proceedings of the 10th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories, , IEEE Press; Palomba, F., Panichella, A., De Lucia, A., Oliveto, R., Zaidman, A., A textual-based technique for Smell Detection (2016) 2016 IEEE 24th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC), , Universita di Salerno, Salerno, Italy.

Indeed, the deep learning algorithms have proved a real performance in the recognition and classification data. In this contest, we present a study of three different speaker recognition system based in Feed Forward neural networks. The first one is the logic regression, the second one is the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the third one is the Stacked Denoising Autoencodeurs (SDA). We evaluated these recognition rates using the parameterization technique Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). To find the best results and to better optimize automatic recognition algorithms, we tested our speaker recognition system under the text-dependent database RSR2015. We studied the recognition rates by varying the values of neural networks parameters, number of neurons and number of hidden layers...etc. We discussed the different results obtained and we selected best parameter values which lead the minimum rate error of recognition. © 2016 IEEE.",feed forward networks; logistic regression; multilayers perceptron; Speaker recognition; stacked denoising autoencoders; text-dependent mode,Character recognition; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Multilayers; Autoencoders; Feed-forward network; Logistic regressions; Speaker recognition; text-dependent mode; Speech recognition,"Bengio, Y., Learning deep architecture for AI (2009) Foundation and Trends in Machine Learning; LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., Hinton, G., Deep learning (2015) Review Nature, 521, pp. 436-444; Hennebert, J., (1998) Hidden Markov Models and Artificiel Neural Networks for Speech and Speaker Recognition, , PHD Thesis no. 1860 EPFL; Bishop, C.M., (1995) Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition, , Oxford: Oxford University Press 1995; (1988) DARPA Neural Network Stdy, , DARPA Neural Network Study (U.

A popular benchmark for evaluating models for visual reasoning is Visual Question Answering (VQA), which aims at answering questions about a given input image by joining the two modalities: (1) the text representing the question, as well as, (2) the visual information extracted from the input image. In this work, we propose a structured approach for VQA that is based on dynamic graphs learned automatically from the input. Unlike the common approach for VQA that relies on an attention mechanism applied on a cell-structured global embedding of the image, our model leverages the rich structure in the image depicted in the object instances and their interaction. In our model, nodes in the graph correspond to object instances present in the image while the edges represent relations among them. Our model automatically constructs the scene graph and attends to the relations among the nodes to answer the given question. Hence, our model can be trained end-to-end and it does not require additional training labels in the form of predefined graphs or relations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging open-ended Visual Genome [14] benchmark for VQA. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,Deep learning; Pattern recognition; Attention mechanisms; Dynamic scenes; Evaluating models; Question Answering; Rich structure; Structured approach; Visual information; Visual reasoning; Graph theory,"Agrawal, A., VQA: Visual question answering (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 2425-2433. , pp; Anderson, P., Bottom-up and top-down attention for image captioning and visual question answering (2018) CVPR; Andreas, J., Rohrbach, M., Darrell, T., Klein, D., Neural module networks (2016) CVPR; Bouchard, G., Singh, S., Trouillon, T., (2015) On Approximate Reasoning Capabilities of Low-Rank Vector Spaces, , AAAI; Conneau, A., Kiela, D., Schwenk, H., Barrault, L., Bordes, A., Supervised learning of universal sentence representations from natural language inference data (2017) EMNLP; Harzig, P., Eggert, C., Lienhart, R., Visual question answering with a hybrid convolution recurrent model (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval, pp. 318-325. , pp., ACM; Deng, Z., Vahdat, A., Hu, H., Mori, G., Structure inference machines: Recurrent neural networks for analyzing relations in group activity recognition (2016) CVPR; Hu, R., Andreas, J., Rohrbach, M., Darrell, T., Saenko, K., Learning to reason: End-to-end module networks for visual question answering (2017) ICCV; Johnson, J., Hariharan, B., van der Maaten, L., Fei-Fei, L., Zitnick, C.L., Girshick, R., CLEVR: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning (2017) CVPR; Johnson, J., (2015) Image Retrieval Using Scene Graphs, , CVPR; Kembhavi, A., Salvato, M., Kolve, E., Seo, M., Hajishirzi, H., Farhadi, A., A diagram is worth a dozen images (2016) ECCV 2016.

Mentors can be implemented as Intelligent Pedagogical Agents (IPAs) in order to motivate students: ""The first way such systems [IPAs] must evolve is to directly address 21st century skills such as creativity, critical thinking, communication, collaboration, information literacy, and self-direction."" AI provides the tools to build computational models of student's skills and scaffold learning. Further, AI methods can act as catalyst in learning environments to provide knowledge about the domain, students, and teaching strategies through integration of cognitive and emotional modelling, knowledge representation, reasoning, natural language question answering, and machine learning methods. In this paper, we describe the design and development of an Intelligent Pedagogical Agent that will guide the students through the use of a Serious Game implemented to teach STEM subjects. The use of IPAs is proposed as a support during the game evolution because they act as learning facilitators and guide the learners in the virtual environment by explaining topics, answering questions, giving feedbacks, helping the learners to collaborate with others, providing personalized learning support. The IPA that we propose in this paper behaves along two paths: Emotional, as the interaction depends on the feelings of the student, and pedagogical, i.e., by giving tips and advices related to the topics and to the tasks assigned. The emotional part of the IPA has been built conducting a study on emotions with high school students. On top of the results coming from the study, it has been built an Android application that uses the IPA as a standalone application to prove the efficacy of the IPA itself.",Emotional learning; Empirical design; Intelligent pedagogical agent; Serious game,Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Education; Education computing; Knowledge representation; Learning systems; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Scaffolds; Teaching; Virtual reality; Design and Development; Emotional learning; Empirical design; Intelligent pedagogical agents; Machine learning methods; Natural language questions; Serious games; Standalone applications; Students,"Conati, C., Probabilistic assessment of user's emotions in educational games (2002) Applied Artificial Intelligence, 16 (7-8), pp. 555-575. , August 2002; Darling-Hammond, L., Orcutt, S., Strobel, K.K., Kirsch, E., Lit, I., Martin, D., Feelings count: Emotions and learning, , The learning classroom, chapter 5.

In order to understand the correlation between these factors towards building a risk map that can alert drivers of dangerous zones, the visual patterns reasoning system is proposed. By converting sensing data collected from different resources to raster images, the accident patterns can be treated as visual patterns that can conserve spatiotemporal information of events. Deep learning techniques are utilized to build a model based on these raster images towards detecting places with a high probability of accidents. Image clustering is applied to learn a representation of each type of correlations. Thus, the visual pattern of high-probability traffic accidents can be reasoned in the natural language format. The very first result of the ongoing project shows the promising research direction. Currently, only spatial information is stored in raster images and no comparison to related methods is made. In the future, temporal information will be integrated with spatial information to create raster videos towards understanding a correlation of environment, congestion, and human reaction before and after accidents happened. This could help to predict time and place which has a high probability of accidents, and a situation of congestion after accidents happened. © 2018 IEEE.",Congestion; Deep learning; Image clustering; Knowledge discovery; Natural disaster; Pattern reasoning; Raster image; Sensing data; Social networks; Traffic accident,Data mining; Deep learning; Disasters; Highway accidents; Knowledge engineering; Maps; Probability; Rasterization; Social networking (online); Traffic congestion; Visual languages; Congestion; Image clustering; Natural disasters; Pattern reasoning; Raster image; Sensing data; Accidents,"Chang, G.L., Xiang, H., (2003) The Relationship between Congestion Levels and Accidents, , State Highway Administration Research Report; Gao, J.H., Chen, X.J., Woodward, A., Liu, X.B., Wu, H.X., Lu, Y.G., Li, L.P., Liu, Q.Y., The association between meteorological factors and road traffic injuries: A case analysis from Shantou city, China (2016) Scientific Reports, 6, pp. 1-10. , 37300; Dailey, D.J., (2006) The Use of Weather Data to Predict Non-recurring Traffic Congestion, , Technical Report, University of Washington; Richard, R., Ray, S., A tale of two cities: Analyzing road accidents with big spatial data (2017) 2017 IEEE Int.

Here, Labour Market Intelligence refers to the design and definition of automated methodologies and tools for supporting real-time labour market monitoring at a very fine-grained level. This, in turn, represents a competitive advantage to labour market stakeholders with respect to classical survey-based analyses, as they are quite expensive and may require up to one year before being available.

Reasoning with these Web job advertisements can effectively support the decision marking processes of several labour market stakeholders, including public organisations, educational and employment agencies, and analysts as well. Here, Labour Market Intelligence refers to the design and definition of automated methodologies and tools for supporting real-time labour market monitoring at a very fine-grained level. This, in turn, represents a competitive advantage to labour market stakeholders with respect to classical survey-based analyses, as they are quite expensive and may require up to one year before being available. In this paper we discuss how Web job vacancies have been collected from selected websites, processed, and classified over a standard taxonomy through machine learning algorithms, extracting the most relevant skills from raw texts. Then, we show how our approach has been applied to some real-life studies and we discuss the benefits provided to end users.",Big Data; Machine Learning; Text Classification,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Classification (of information); Commerce; Competition; Database systems; Decision making; Education; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Text processing; Competitive advantage; Employment agencies; End users; Fine grained; Job opportunities; Labour market; Public organisation; Text classification; Employment,"Amato, F., Boselli, R., Cesarini, M., Mercorio, F., Mezzanzanica, M., Moscato, V., Persia, F., Picariello, A., Challenge: Processing web texts for classifying job offers (2015) IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing; Amato, F., Colace, F., Greco, L., Moscato, V., Picariello, A., Semantic processing of multimedia data for e-government applications (2016) J.

In contrast to prior work, our approach includes a reward function that takes the accuracy, diversity, and efficiency into consideration.

Explainable artificial intelligence is gaining considerable attention among researchers and developers to address this requirement. Although there is an increasing number of works on interpretable and transparent machine learning algorithms, they are mostly intended for the technical users. Explanations for the end-user have been neglected in many usable and practical applications. In this work, we present the Contextual Importance (CI) and Contextual Utility (CU) concepts to extract explanations that are easily understandable by experts as well as novice users. This method explains the prediction results without transforming the model into an interpretable one. We present an example of providing explanations for linear and non-linear models to demonstrate the generalizability of the method. CI and CU are numerical values that can be represented to the user in visuals and natural language form to justify actions and explain reasoning for individual instances, situations, and contexts. We show the utility of explanations in car selection example and Iris flower classification by presenting complete (i.e. the causes of an individual prediction) and contrastive explanation (i.e. contrasting instance against the instance of interest). The experimental results show the feasibility and validity of the provided explanation methods. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Black-box models; Contextual importance; Contextual utility; Contrastive explanations; Explainable AI,Autonomous agents; Forecasting; Intelligent agents; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Visual languages; Autonomous systems; Black-box model; Contextual importance; Contextual utility; Contrastive explanations; Individual prediction; Natural languages; Non-linear model; Multi agent systems,"Biran, O., Cotton, C., Explanation and justification in machine learning: A survey (2017) IJCAI 17 Workshop on Explainable AI (XAI; Anjomshoae, S., Najjar, A., Calvaresi, D., Främling, K., Explainable agents and robots: Results from a systematic literature review (2019) Proceedings of the 18Th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems; Samek, W., Wiegand, T., Müller, K.R., (2017) Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Understanding, Visualizing and Interpreting Deep Learning Models, , arXiv preprint arXiv; Ras, G., van Gerven, M., Haselager, P., Explanation methods in deep learning: Users, values, concerns and challenges (2018) Explainable and Interpretable Models in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

Hence, being able to identify, locate, measure, and assess competence occupants can be a decisive competitive edge. In this work, we introduce a framework that assists with performing such tasks. To achieve this, NLP-, rule-based, and machine learning techniques are employed to process raw data such as academic publications or patents. The framework gains normalized person and organization profiles and compiles identified entities (such as persons, organizations, or locations) into dedicated objects disambiguating and unifying where needed. The objects are then mapped with conceptual systems and stored along with identified semantic relations in a Knowledge Graph, which is constituted by RDF triples. An OWL reasoner allows for answering complex business queries, and in particular, to analyze and evaluate competences on multiple aggregation levels (i.e., single vs. collective) and dimensions (e.g., region, technological field of interest, time). In order to prove the general applicability of the framework and to illustrate how to solve concrete business cases from the automotive domain, it is evaluated with different datasets. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Competence analysis; Competence assessment; Competence detection; Computational linguistics; Corporate strategy; Data mining; Decision making; Expert matching; Expert mining; Information extraction; Information retrieval; Innovation ecosystem; Knowledge graph; Knowledge representation; Machine learning; Name disambiguation; Name normalization; Natural language processing; Ontology; Patent analysis; Question-answering; Reasoning; Semantic analysis; Semantic technologies,Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Decision making; Ecology; Ecosystems; Education; Information retrieval; Knowledge engineering; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Patents and inventions; Semantic Web; Semantics; Competence analysis; Competence assessments; Corporate strategies; Expert matching; Knowledge graphs; Name disambiguation; Name normalization; Patent analysis; Question Answering; Reasoning; Semantic analysis; Semantic technologies; Data mining,"Aswani, N., Bontcheva, K., Cunningham, H., Mining information for instance unification (2006) ISWC 2006.

Knowledge graphs need to be easily maintainable and usable in sometimes complex application settings. Often, scaling knowledge graph updates can require developing a knowledge curation pipeline that either replaces the graph wholesale whenever updates are made, or requires detailed tracking of knowledge provenance across multiple data sources. Fig. 1 shows how Whyis provides a semantic analysis ecosystem: an environment that supports research and development of semantic analytics for which we previously had to build custom applications [3,4]. Users interact through a suite of knowledge graph views driven by the node type and view requested in the URL. Knowledge curation methods include Semantic ETL, external linked data mapping,and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Autonomous inference agents expand the available knowledge using traditional deductive reasoning as well as inductive methods that can include predictive models, statistical reasoners, and machine learning. Whyis is used in a number of areas today, including nanopolymers, spectrum policy, and health informatics. We demonstrate Whyis by creating and deploying an example Biological Knowledge Graph (BioKG), using data from DrugBank and Uniprot1, and briefly discuss benefits of using our approach over a conventional knowledge graph pipeline. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

For example, the modeling of natural language semantics expressed by text, images, speech in information search (e.g. Google, Yahoo,..) or DNA sequence labeling in Bioinformatics represent distinguished cases of successful use of statistical machine learning. The reason of this success is due to the ability to overcome the concrete limitations of logic/rule-based approaches to semantic modeling: although, from a knowledge engineer perspective, rules are natural methods to encode system semantics, noise, ambiguity and errors affecting dynamic systems, prevent such approached from being effective, e.g. they are not flexible enough. In contrast, statistical relational learning, applied to representations of system states, i.e. training examples, can produce semantic models of system behavior based on a large number attributes. As the values of the latter are automatically learned, they reflect the flexibility of statistical settings and the overall model is robust to unexpected system condition changes. Unfortunately, while attribute weight and their relations with other attributes can be automatically learned from examples, their design for representing the target object (e.g. a system state) has to be manually carry out. This requires expertise, intuition and deep knowledge about the expected system behavior. A typical difficult task is for example the conversion of structures into attribute-value representations. Kernel Methods are powerful techniques designed within the statistical learning theory. They can be used in learning algorithms in place of attributes, thus simplifying object representation. More specifically, kernel functions can define structural and semantic similarities between objects (e.g. states) at abstract level, replacing the similarity defined in terms of attribute overlap. In this chapter, we provide the basic notions of machine learning along with latest theoretical results obtained in recent years. First, we show traditional and simple machine learning algorithms based on attribute-value representations and probability notions such as the Naive Bayes and the Decision Tree classifiers. Second, we introduce the PAC learning theory and the Perceptron algorithm to provide the readers with essential concepts of modern machine learning. Finally, we use the above background to illustrate a simplified theory of Support Vector Machines, which, along with the kernel methods, are the ultimate product of the statistical learning theory. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,Abstract levels; Attribute weight; Automatic-learning; Decision tree classifiers; Deep knowledge; Information search; Kernel function; Kernel methods; Knowledge Engineers; Modern machines; Naive Bayes; Natural language semantics; Object representations; Overall-model; PAC learning; Pattern analysis; Perceptron algorithms; Relational learning; Semantic Model; Semantic modeling; Semantic similarity; Sequence Labeling; Statistical learning theory; Statistical relational learning; System behaviors; System conditions; System semantics; System state; Target object; Theoretical result; Training example; Decision tree classifiers; Natural language semantics; Object representations; Perceptron algorithms; Semantic similarity; Statistical learning theory; Statistical machine learning; Statistical relational learning; Abstracting; Bioinformatics; Decision trees; Design; Formal methods; Internet; Learning systems; Machinery; Mathematical models; Search engines; Semantics; Statistics; Abstracting; Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Data mining; Decision trees; Distributed computer systems; Formal methods; Learning systems; Machinery; Modeling languages; Search engines; Semantics; Statistics; Learning algorithms; Learning algorithms,"Aiolli, F., Martino, G.D.S., Moschitti, A., Sperduti, A., (2006) Fast On-line Kernel Learning for Trees.

This paper, to the best of our knowledge, presents the first attempt of automatically solving Arabic arithmetic word problems. In addition, as part of this work, we prepared an Arabic annotated dataset by translating a standard arithmetic word problems English dataset (AddSub Dataset). The AddSub dataset has been used by several researchers to evaluate their models for English arithmetic word problems. The proposed algorithm relies on our automatic verbs learning approach based on the training dataset. Moreover, the algorithm utilizes various NLP tools to assign objects to problem states until reaching to the goal state such as Stanford Parser, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Cosine Metric Distance. Our approach overcomes various issues such as tracking both entities and their related results during the transfer process as well as dealing with different forms of the same verb. The performance evaluation process showed promising results resolving 80.78% of the problems. On the other hand, there are still several areas that can be extended and improved.

Despite the vast empirical evidence supporting this belief, theoretical justifications to date are limited. In particular, they do not account for the locality, sharing and pooling constructs of convolutional networks, the most successful deep learning architecture to date. In this work we derive a deep network architecture based on arithmetic circuits that inherently employs locality, sharing and pooling. An equivalence between the networks and hierarchical tensor factorizations is established. We show that a shallow network corresponds to CP (rank-1) decomposition, whereas a deep network corresponds to Hierarchical Tucker decomposition. Using tools from measure theory and matrix algebra, we prove that besides a negligible set, all functions that can be implemented by a deep network of polynomial size, require exponential size in order to be realized (or even approximated) by a shallow network. Since log-space computation transforms our networks into SimNets, the result applies directly to a deep learning architecture demonstrating promising empirical performance. The construction and theory developed in this paper shed new light on various practices and ideas employed by the deep learning community. © 2016 N. Cohen, O. Sharir & A.

OSNs generate a huge massive volume of unstructured data making it difficult for the LEAs to ‘patrol the facts’ and to gather intelligence in order to provide it to the legal domain. There is no ontology model, among those found in literature, that allows to exhaustively describe all the aspects of crime investigation targeting data integration, information sharing, collection and preservation of digital evidences by using biometric features, and query answering. To bridge this gap, this paper presents an extended version of our earlier SMONT ontology, called CISMO as a semantic tool suitable for gathering digital evidence from OSNs helping LEAs to develop new investigative systems to counter the threat of different crimes. The new version introduces the core concepts related to crime cases in the police repositories, biometric data and digital evidences collected by OSNs, making it possible for LEAs to classify crimes, investigate hidden crime patterns or predict future crime patterns. CISMO is more concise and has a richer concept knowledge-based compared with the previous version SMONT. We prove the effectiveness of CISMO in a case study covering some general aspects in criminal cases in OSNs, demonstrating how this semantic approach can help LEAs to gather knowledge for crime investigation using natural language processing and machine learning to process messages shared in an online platform and also applying reasoning rules, as semantic inferences. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Biometrics; Crime; Digital evidence; Online social networks; Ontology; Reasoning; Security,Biometrics; Crime; Data integration; Knowledge based systems; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Social networking (online); Biometric features; Crime investigation; Criminal activities; Information sharing; Legal enforcement; NAtural language processing; Online social networks (OSNs); Semantic inference; Computer crime,"Yaqoob, I., Hashem, I.A.T., Gani, A., Mokhtar, S., Ahmed, E., Anuar, N.B., Vasilakos, A.V., Big data: From beginning to future (2016) Int.

Using the notion of attribution (word importance), we find that these deep networks often ignore important question terms. Leveraging such behavior, we perturb questions to craft a variety of adversarial examples. Our strongest attacks drop the accuracy of a visual question answering model from 61.1% to 19%, and that of a tabular question answering model from 33.5% to 3.3%. Additionally, we show how attributions can strengthen attacks proposed by Jia and Liang (2017) on paragraph comprehension models. Our results demonstrate that attributions can augment standard measures of accuracy and empower investigation of model performance. When a model is accurate but for the wrong reasons, attributions can surface erroneous logic in the model that indicates inadequacies in the test data. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics",,Computational linguistics;

In contrast, humans can generally justify, in natural language, for their answer to a visual question with simple common sense reasoning. However, human introspection abilities have their own limits as one often struggles to justify for the recognition process behind our lowest level feature recognition ability: for instance, it is difficult to precisely explain why a given texture seems more characteristic of the surface of a finger nail rather than a plastic bottle. In this paper, we showcase an application in which deep learning models can actually help human experts justify for their own low-level visual recognition process: We study the problem of assessing the adhesive potency of copper sheets from microscopic pictures of their surface. Although highly trained material experts are able to qualitatively assess the surface adhesive potency, they are often unable to precisely justify for their decision process. We present a model that, under careful design considerations, is able to provide visual clues for human experts to understand and justify for their own recognition process. Not only can our model assist human experts in their interpretation of the surface characteristics, we show how this model can be used to test different hypothesis of the copper surface response to different manufacturing processes. © 2019 IEEE.",Interpretability; Texture-analysis; Weakly-supervised-segmentation,Adhesives; Bottles; Computer vision; Copper; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Plastic bottles; Textures; Commonsense reasoning; Design considerations; Internal representation; Interpretability; Manufacturing process; Supervised segmentation; Surface characteristics; Texture analysis; Visual languages,"Antol, S., Agrawal, A., Lu, J., Mitchell, M., Batra, D., Lawrence Zitnick, C., Parikh, D., Vqa: Visual question answering (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 2425-2433; Arandjelovic, R., Gronat, P., Torii, A., Pajdla, T., Sivic, J., Netvlad: Cnn architecture for weakly supervised place recognition (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5297-5307; Bilen, H., Pedersoli, M., Tuytelaars, T., Weakly supervised object detection with posterior regularization (2014) British Machine Vision Conference, 3; Bilen, H., Pedersoli, M., Tuytelaars, T., Weakly supervised object detection with convex clustering (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1081-1089; Bilen, H., Vedaldi, A., Weakly supervised deep detection networks (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2846-2854; Carter, S., Armstrong, Z., Schubert, L., Johnson, I., Olah, C., Activation atlas (2019) Distill, 4 (3), p. e15; Chen, H., Engkvist, O., Wang, Y., Olivecrona, M., Blaschke, T., The rise of deep learning in drug discovery (2018) Drug Discovery Today, 23 (6), pp. 1241-1250; Evans, R., Jumper, J., Kirkpatrick, J., Sifre, L., Green, T., Qin, C., Zidek, A., Penedones, H., De novo structure prediction with deeplearning based scoring (2018) Annu Rev Biochem, 77, pp. 363-382; Gawehn, E., Hiss, J.A., Schneider, G., Deep learning in drug discovery (2016) Molecular Informatics, 35 (1), pp. 3-14; Girshick, R., Fast r-cnn (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 1440-1448; Girshick, R., Donahue, J., Darrell, T., Malik, J., Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation (2014) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 580-587; Goh, G.B., Hodas, N.O., Vishnu, A., Deep learning for computational chemistry (2017) Journal of Computational Chemistry, 38 (16), pp. 1291-1307; Goyal, Y., Khot, T., Summers-Stay, D., Batra, D., Parikh, D., Making the v in vqa matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in visual question answering (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 6904-6913; Hansen, K., Biegler, F., Ramakrishnan, R., Pronobis, W., Von Lilienfeld, O.A., Muller, K.-R., Tkatchenko, A., Machine learning predictions of molecular properties: Accurate many-body potentials and nonlocality in chemical space (2015) The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, 6 (12), pp. 2326-2331; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Spatial pyramid pooling in deep convolutional networks for visual recognition (2015) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 37 (9), pp. 1904-1916; Ke, R., Bugeau, A., Papadakis, N., Schuetz, P., Schönlieb, C.-B., (2019) A Multi-task U-net for Segmentation with Lazy Labels; Lee, K., Zung, J., Li, P., Jain, V., Seung, H.S., (2017) Superhuman Accuracy on the snemi3d Connectomics Challenge; Li, W., Field, K.G., Morgan, D., Automated defect analysis in electron microscopic images (2018) Npj Computational Materials, 4 (1), p. 36; Li, W., Yuan, Z., Fang, X., Wang, C., Knowing where to look?

Consistently, individuals send in excess of a billion messages to organizations and associations through numerous messaging applications. The most usual method for building chatbots is the state machine approach which usually involves creating distinctive states and dependent on some logic invoking actions. But, with the increase in the number of states, lot of rules are required to be added, with additional logic, and hence create a delicate code which is difficult to keep up and maintain. In this work, we have shown how the stateless approach of building a chatbot using Rasa Core eliminated the need of complex state machine approach, as it makes use of machine learning-based dialog management. Along with this, we trained the model separately with the two pipelines “spacy” and “Tensorflow embedding”. We evaluated the two pipelines with cross-validation and without cross-validation for intent classification. The result showed that, with more training examples, Tensorflow embedding shows good accuracy for intent classification. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Natural language understanding; Spacy; Tensorflow embedding,Computer circuits; Embeddings; Pipelines; Additional logic; Chatbot; Chatbots; Cross validation; Dialog management; Number of state; State machine approaches; Training example; Artificial intelligence,"Bocklisch, T, Faulker, J, Pawlowski, N, Nichol, A, (2017) Rasa: open source language understanding and dialogue management, , ArXiv Prepr.

It has been one of the most researched areas in machine learning with various applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, language detection and spam filter etc. The efficiency of text classification improves, when some relation or pattern in the data is given or known, which can be provided by ontology. It further helps in reducing the size of dataset. Ontology is a collection of data items that helps in storing and representing data in a way that preserves the patterns in it and its semantic relationship with each other. We have attempted to verify the improvement provided by the use of ontology in classification algorithms. The code prepared in this research and the method developed is pretty generic, and could be extended to any ontology based text classification system. In this paper, we present an enhanced architecture that can uses ontology to provide an effective text classification mechanism. We have introduced an ontology based text classification algorithm by utilizing the rich semantic information in Disease ontology (DOID). We summarize the existing work and finally advocate that the ontology based text classification strategy is better as compared to conventional text classification in terms of different metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-measure etc. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

Illustrations and photos are also classified into one of the following semantic classes: buildings, people, nature landscape, and interior. On this basis each image is annotated by its type and class. The key elements of the system - feature extraction and classification methods - are described in detail. A new classifier based on fuzzy logic was proposed. Moreover, we developed the Multi-Classifier, a hierarchical architecture encouraging the creation of hybrid classifiers tailored to the problem being solved. Experimental results of classification efficiency show that our approach is definitely worth further development. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",feature extraction; fuzzy logic; Image annotation; image classification; k-NN; machine learning; SVM; text understanding,Computer circuits; Extraction; Feature extraction; Fuzzy logic; Image analysis; Image classification; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Semantics; Support vector machines; Text processing; Artificial intelligence; Image retrieval; Automatic image annotation; Classification efficiency; Document understanding; Hierarchical architectures; Hybrid classifier; Multi-classifier; System features; text understanding; Feature extraction and classification; Image annotation; Text understanding; Image annotation; Image classification,"Duda, R.O., Hart, P.E., Use of Hough transform to detect lines and curves in pictures (1972) Commun.

However, many real-world problems like environment pollution forecasting apply RNNs on sequences of multi-dimensional data where each dimension represents an individual feature with semantic meaning such as PM2.5 and SO2. RNN interpretation on multi-dimensional sequences is challenging as users need to analyze what features are important at different time steps to better understand model behavior and gain trust in prediction. This requires effective and scalable visualization methods to reveal the complex many-to-many relations between hidden units and features. In this work, we propose a visual analytics system to interpret RNNs on multi-dimensional time-series forecasts. Specifically, to provide an overview to reveal the model mechanism, we propose a technique to estimate the hidden unit response by measuring how different feature selections affect the hidden unit output distribution. We then cluster the hidden units and features based on the response embedding vectors. Finally, we propose a visual analytics system which allows users to visually explore the model behavior from the global and individual levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with case studies using air pollutant forecast applications. © 2020 IEEE.",air pollutant forecast; interpretable machine learning; multi-dimensional time series; recurrent neural networks,Forecasting; Natural language processing systems; Pollution; Semantics; Time series; Visual languages; Visualization; Environment pollution; Multidimensional data; NAtural language processing; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Scalable visualization; Time series forecasts; Visual analytics systems; Visual interpretation; Recurrent neural networks,"Sulfur Dioxide (so2) Pollution, , https://www.epa.gov/so2-pollution/sulfur-dioxide-basics#effects, Accessed: 2019-09-07; Andrews, R., Diederich, J., Tickle, A.B., Survey and critique of techniques for extracting rules from trained artificial neural networks (1995) Knowledge-based Systems, 8 (6), pp. 373-389; Brownlee, J., (2017) Long Short-term Memory Networks with Python: Develop Sequence Prediction Models with Deep Learning, , Machine Learning Mastery; Cao, J., Lee, S., Ho, K., Zhang, X., Zou, S., Fung, K., Chow, J.C., Watson, J.G., Characteristics of carbonaceous aerosol in pearl river delta region, China during 2001 winter period (2003) Atmospheric Environment, 37 (11), pp. 1451-1460; Chen, Y., Cheng, Q., Cheng, Y., Yang, H., Yu, H., Applications of recurrent neural networks in environmental factor forecasting: A review (2018) Neural Computation, 30 (11), pp. 2855-2881; Cho, K., Van Merrienboer, B., Gulcehre, C., Bahdanau, D., Bougares, F., Schwenk, H., Bengio, Y., (2014) Learning Phrase Representations Using Rnn Encoder-decoder for Statistical Machine Translation; Craven, M., Shavlik, J.W., Extracting tree-structured representations of trained networks (1996) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 24-30; Dhillon, I.S., Co-clustering documents and words using bipartite spectral graph partitioning (2001) Proceedings of the Seventh ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 269-274. , ACM; Friedman, J.H., Greedy function approximation: A gradient boosting machine (2001) Annals of Statistics, pp. 1189-1232; Gers, F.A., Eck, D., Schmidhuber, J., Applying lstm to time series predictable through time-window approaches (2002) Neural Nets WIRN Vietri-01, pp. 193-200. , Springer; Hochreiter, S., Untersuchungen zu dynamischen neuronalen netzen (1991) Diploma, Technische Universitat Munchen, 91 (1); Hochreiter, S., Schmidhuber, J., Long short-term memory (1997) Neural Computation, 9 (8), pp. 1735-1780; Karpathy, A., Johnson, J., Fei-Fei, L., (2015) Visualizing and Understanding Recurrent Networks; Kwon, B.C., Choi, M.-J., Kim, J.T., Choi, E., Kim, Y.B., Kwon, S., Sun, J., Choo, J., Retainvis: Visual analytics with interpretable and interactive recurrent neural networks on electronic medical records (2019) IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 25 (1), pp. 299-309; Li, J., Chen, X., Hovy, E., Jurafsky, D., (2015) Visualizing and Understanding Neural Models in Nlp; Lipton, Z.C., (2017) The Doctor Just Won't Accept That; Liu, M., Shi, J., Li, Z., Li, C., Zhu, J., Liu, S., Towards better analysis of deep convolutional neural networks (2017) IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 23 (1), pp. 91-100; Louie, P.K., Watson, J.G., Chow, J.C., Chen, A., Sin, D.W., Lau, A.K., Seasonal characteristics and regional transport of pm2 (2005) 5 in Hong Kong.

While this does not seem like a challenging task, many recent attempts that apply either complex linguistic reasoning or deep neural networks achieve 65%–76% accuracy on benchmark sets. Our approach formulates the task as two machine learning problems: detecting the entities in the question, and classifying the question as one of the relation types in the KB. We train a recurrent neural network to solve each problem. On the SimpleQuestions dataset, our approach yields substantial improvements over previously published results — even neural networks based on much more complex architectures. The simplicity of our approach also has practical advantages, such as efficiency and modularity, that are valuable especially in an industry setting.

Although in recent years we have witnessed increasingly popular use of deep neural networks for sequence modeling, it is still challenging to explain the rationales behind the model outputs, which is essential for building trust and supporting the domain experts to validate, critique and refine the model. We propose ProSeNet, an interpretable and steerable deep sequence model with natural explanations derived from case-based reasoning. The prediction is obtained by comparing the inputs to a few prototypes, which are exemplar cases in the problem domain. For better interpretability, we define several criteria for constructing the prototypes, including simplicity, diversity, and sparsity and propose the learning objective and the optimization procedure. ProSeNet also provides a user-friendly approach to model steering: domain experts without any knowledge on the underlying model or parameters can easily incorporate their intuition and experience by manually refining the prototypes. We conduct experiments on a wide range of real-world applications, including predictive diagnostics for automobiles, ECG, and protein sequence classification and sentiment analysis on texts. The result shows that ProSeNet can achieve accuracy on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models. We also evaluate the interpretability of the results with concrete case studies. Finally, through user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we demonstrate that the model selects high-quality prototypes which align well with human knowledge and can be interactively refined for better interpretability without loss of performance. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In real-life communication, people are spontaneously modulating their tone to accentuate specific points or to express their sentiments. This research work introduces a supervised fuzzy rule-based system for multimodal sentiment classification, that can identify the sentiment expressed in video reviews on social media platform. It has been demonstrated that multimodal sentiment analysis can be effectively performed by the joint use of linguistic and acoustic modalities. In this paper computation of the sentiment using an ingenious set of fuzzy rules has been applied to label the review into: positive or negative sentiment. The confidence score from supervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification of text and speech cues is considered as the input variable for the fuzzy rules. The fusion of fuzzy logic with acoustic and linguistic features for classifying sentiment contributes a new exemplar in multimodal sentiment analysis. Our fuzzy approach has been compared with eight state-of-the-art techniques for supervised machine learning. The experiments on benchmark datasets yield 82.5 % accuracy for our approach which is higher in contrast to the state-of-the-art. © 2020 The Authors.

Research on sexual harassment in social media has been gaining popularity of late, due to the genuine long-term effects such harassment can have on an individual like depression, withdrawal, loss of self-confidence, self-destructive tendencies, and propagation of a conducive environment for sexual assault. The approaches to tackle this issue using technology range from simple lexicon-based models to sophisticated machine learning models. Lexicon-based systems utilize dictionaries that contain offensive words that are characteristic of sexual harassment. Rule-based approaches need to be supplemented with logical reasoning in order to define rules which can be matched with the text to distinguish sexual harassment. Machine learning approaches develop predictive models that can detect sexually offensive messages. This paper holistically studies approaches used to solve the problem of classification of sexual harassment in cyberspace and aims to determine the best directions for future research in this field. It also studies the methods of analyzing the social network in terms of the structure of ties between users that can be used to study specific user patterns and characteristics. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Lexicon-based systems; Machine learning approaches; Rule-Based Systems; Sexual harassment; Social network analysis; Twitter,,"Peddinti, S.T., Ross, K.W., Cappos, J., On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog (2014) Proceedings of the Second Edition of the ACM Conference on Online Social Networks—COSN ’14; Xu, Z., Zhu, S., Filtering offensive language in online communities using grammatical relations (2010) Proceedings of the Seventh Annual Collaboration, Electronic Messaging, Anti-Abuse and Spam Conference (CEAS’10); Chen, Y., Zhou, Y., Zhu, S., Xu, H., Detecting offensive language in social media to protect adolescent online safety, in Proceedings of the 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Social Computing and 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Privacy Security Risk and Trust ser (2012) SOCIALCOM-PASSAT ’12, pp. 71-80. , pp; Bretschneider, U., Wöhner, T., Peters, R., (2014) Detecting Online Harassment in Social Networks, , http://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=icis2014; Chatzakou, D., Kourtellis, N., Blackburn, J., Cristofaro, E.D., Stringhini, G., Vakali, A., (2017) Mean Birds: Detecting Aggression and Bullying on Twitter; Khatua, A., Cambria, E., Khatua, A., Sounds of silence breakers: Exploring sexual violence on twitter (2018) 2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); Goenaga, I., Atutxa, A., Gojenola, K., Casillas, A., de Ilarraza, A.D., Ezeiza, N., Oronoz, M., de Vinaspre, O.P., Automatic misogyny identification using neural networks (2018) Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Evaluation of Human Language Technologies for Iberian Languages (Ibereval 2018), Co-Located with 34Th Conference of the Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing (SEPLN, p. 2018. , CEUR Workshop Proceedings.

Machine learning based word sense disambiguation and First Order Predicate Logic(FOPL) based semantic checking are the two main features of this paper. The word arrangement in dictionary with POS tags and word sense is an other important factor that can contribute to the efficiency of the translation system.

While most approaches concentrate on modeling the structural information of the graph, part of the work also focuses on fusing entity descriptions, allowing entities to be fused with richer semantics. However, the complex entity text descriptions contain a lot of noise, which reduces the semantic purity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel sememes-based framework for knowledge graph to streamline the semantic space of entities. More specifically, We replace entity descriptions with a finite set of semantics and encode the sememe labels of entities using a pre-trained Bert model, and finally jointly learning the symbolic triples and sememe labels. The experimental results show that our method outperforms other baselines on the task of link prediction and entity classification. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Knowledge graph embedding; Link prediction; Sememes-based description,Embeddings; Knowledge representation; Semantics; Complex entities; Comprehensive information; Knowledge graphs; Link prediction; Low dimensional; Machine learning models; Semantic Space; Structural information; Learning systems,"Bloomfield, L., A set of postulates for the science of language (1926) Language, 2 (3), pp. 153-164; Bollacker, K., Evans, C., Paritosh, P., Sturge, T., Taylor, J., Freebase: A collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1247-1250. , pp; Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Garcia-Duran, A., Weston, J., Yakhnenko, O., Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data (2013) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2787-2795. , pp; Devlin, J., Chang, M.W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., (2018) Bert: Pre-Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding.

The objective of CAPTCHA is to give genuine services to every user by minimize automated approaches. An efficient CAPTCHA must be not only human friendly, but also robust enough to resist to machine attacks for pass CAPTCHA test. Many CAPTCHAs have been proposed in literature like text-graphical based, video based, mathematical or questions based. The miscreants attempt to effectively bypass these CAPTCHA test by use optical recognition or machine learning techniques. The design and implementation of CAPTCHA lie in the domain of artificial intelligence. We aim to design a CAPTCHA, which will effectively use by modern digitize world and turn to reduce the optical recognition and other automated attacks. In this paper, for better security issues, a non OCR CAPTCHA design called digital CAPTCHA based on Mathematical Boolean algebra by use digital logic gates. The different logic gates design which depict shapes like (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR). Each gate executes multiple answers based on Boolean algebra by use Boolean laws. For prove human, user recognize shapes of logic gates and choose a correct answer from multiple answers. The experimental results analyze by multiple technical and non technical users with different age groups. The resulting values show that our proposed system has high probability and security and resists the visual attacks with existing math CAPTCHAs. © 2016 IEEE.",Boolean algebra; Digital CAPTCHA; Digital gates; math CAPTCHA; non OCR; OCR; Security,Algebra; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Computer circuits; Design; Electronic mail filters; Learning systems; Logic gates; Network security; Optical character recognition; Reconfigurable hardware; Security of data; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; CAPTCHAs; Design and implementations; Digital gates; Digital logic gates; Machine learning techniques; Non-technical users; Optical recognition; Security; Boolean algebra,"Choudhary, S., Understanding CAPTCHA: Text and audio based captcha with its applications (2013) International Journal of Advance Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering, 3 (6). , June; Chandrakant Mutha, N., 3d handwritten animated captcha algorithm: Web security (2013) International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology (IJERT), 2 (10). , October; Kaur, K., CAPTCHA and its Techniques: A review International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies; Samariya, D., Designing CAPTCHA for web security using rotating and spiliting image against OCR software (2015) International Journal of Advance Research in Computer Science and Management Studies, 3 (2). , February; Shankar, D., Hybrid collage CAPTCHA (2013) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 4 (1). , January; Methews, P., Scene tagging image Based CAPTCHA using image composition and object relationships (2010) ACM, , April 13-16; Mehrnejd, M., SEMICHA: A new semantic image CAPTCHA using geometric transformations The ISC Int'l Journal of Information Security, September 2012, 4 (1), pp. 63-76; Kaur, R., Choudhary, P., A novel approach on Boolean algebra to enhance web security (2015) International Journal of Computer Applications, 127 (11). , October; Cui, J., A CAPTCHA implementation based on moving objects recognition problems 2010 International Conference on E-Business and E-Government; Zhu, B.B., Yan, J., Captcha-as graphical passwords-a new security primitive based on hard AI Problems (2014) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 9 (6). , June; Goswami, G., FaceDCAPTCHA: Face detection based color image CAPTCHA (2012) ELSEVIER Future Generation Computer Systems; Pandey, Y., Evaluating the usability and security of a spelling based CAPTCHA system (2014) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies, 5 (3); Bursztein, E., Text-based CAPTCHA strengths and weakness ACM Computer and Communication Security 2011 (CSS'2011); Powell, B.M., FgCAPTCHA: Genetically optimized face image CAPTCHA (2014) IEEE Access, 2; Payal, N., JigCAPTCHA: An advanced image based CAPTCHA integrated with Jigsaw piece Puzzle using AJAX (2012) International Journal of Soft Computing and Engineering, 2 (5). , November; El Ahmad, A., CAPTCHA design color, usability and security (2012) IEEE Computing Society; Javier Hernandez-Castro, C., Pitfalls in CAPTCHA design and implementation: The Math CAPTCHA, a case study (2010) ELSEVIER Computer & Security, 29, pp. 141-157; El Ahmad, A., Yan, J., CAPTCHA design color, usability and security (2012) IEEE Internet Computing; Math CAPTCHA Image, , http://www.sitepoint.com/better-captcha/",,Cognizant;DRDO;et al.;IEEE;ISRO;SSN,Presses Polytechniques Et Universitaires Romandes,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Communications, Signal Processing and Networking, WiSPNET 2016",23 March 2016 through 25 March 2016,,123771,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992046971

In contrast to desktop, limited screen space of mobile carrying variety of ineffectual content magnifies the visual complexity of webpage by disrupting focus of user to read useful content. To solve this issue, Reader mode functionality renders a clutter-free version of web page by stripping out all insignificant elements and letting user to read the content they are actually interested in. Existing implementation in our browser involves 2 modules - Article Detection module that runs heuristics to detect whether a web page is article or not, proceeded by Article Extraction module that extracts the main content of the web page by removing all unwanted elements. Our paper focusses on improving the accuracy of article detection logic by proposing a machine-learning based solution that significantly surpasses the present heuristic-based model in terms of accuracy. In order to get rid of false positives on webpages with meaningless content like product descriptions, we extended our previous solution [1] by incorporating backward-elimination heuristics for web page title and extracting strong Boolean predictors. Our approach also solves the problem of detecting reader mode on Google's AMP HTML web pages where main-content is rendered in an iframe. With this model, we were able to achieve a precision of 0.99 and a recall of 0.94, which outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques which are being used by the major Android based web browsers in the market today. © 2021 IEEE.",Adaboost; AMP Pages; AutoML; DOM; Feature Engineering; Machine Learning; Normalization; On device AI; Outlier; PCA; Readability; ROC; Web Browser; Winsorization,Machine learning; Rendering (computer graphics); Turing machines; Web browsers; Backward elimination; Boolean predictors; Detection logic; Detection modules; Product descriptions; State-of-the-art techniques; Text-based features; Visual complexity; Websites,"Nayak, P., Thadichi, B., Patidar, H., Article detection on the web using dom and text based features (2019) 2019 IEEE 16th India Council International Conference (INDICON), pp. 1-4. , Rajkot, India; Zhang, T., Learning structured representation for the text classification via reinforcement (2018) AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Mierzwik, B., Methods for web content analysis and context detection PSU CS Fall 2015 Capstone Group D for Mozilla Foundation; Kohlschütter, C., Boilerplate detection using shallow text features (2010) Proc.

With the denotation, e.g., the membership function of class {Adult}, we can make new probability prediction, e.g., likelihood function, for changed P(x). However, existing methods including Likelihood Method and Bayesian Inference cannot resolve this problem. For this purpose, the author proposes and proves the third kind of Bayes&#x2019; Theorem, which includes two asymmetrical Bayes&#x2019; formulas. The membership function so obtained is equivalent to that from random set statistics proposed by Peizhuang Wang. When samples are very big so that there are continuous sampling distributions P(x, y), we can directly derive a group of membership functions by a new Bayes formula. If samples are not big enough, we can use the semantic information formula, a generalized Kullback-Leibler formula, to optimize the membership functions by sampling distributions. The semantic information criterion is compatible with maximum likelihood criterion and Regularized Least Squares (RLS) criterion. In comparison with the likelihood function and the Bayesian posterior, the membership function so obtained as the predictive model can be used with new source P(x) to produce new likelihood function for better generalization performance. New Bayes&#x2019; formulas and the semantic information method can be applied to machine learning. The paper simply introduces their applications to (1) multi-label classifications; (2) maximum mutual information classifications for unseen instances; and (3) mixture models. It is shown that new methods are very simple and reliable. It seems that the membership function so obtained can bridge the gap between logic and probability. With this membership function, we can develop a new mathematical tool: Logical Bayesian Inference. &#x00A9; 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Bayes&#x2019; theorem; Likelihood function; Logical probability; Machine learning; Membership function; Multi-label classification; Natural language processing; Semantic information,Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Cognitive systems; Inference engines; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Maximum likelihood; Natural language processing systems; Sampling; Semantics; Signal processing; Stereophonic broadcasting; Generalization performance; Likelihood functions; Maximum likelihood criteria; Maximum mutual information; Multi label classification; NAtural language processing; Regularized least squares; Semantic information; Membership functions,"Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy sets (1965) Inf.

Integrating or searching over this information benefits from understanding its intended meaning and making it explicit in a semantic representation language like RDF. Most current approaches to generating Semantic Web representations from tables requires human input to create schemas and often results in graphs that do not follow best practices for linked data. Evidence for a table's meaning can be found in its column headers, cell values, implicit relations between columns, caption and surrounding text but also requires general and domain-specific background knowledge. We describe techniques grounded in graphical models and probabilistic reasoning to infer meaning associated with a table. Using background knowledge from the Linked Open Data cloud, we jointly infer the semantics of column headers, table cell values (e.g., strings and numbers) and relations between columns and represent the inferred meaning as graph of RDF triples. A table's meaning is thus captured by mapping columns to classes in an appropriate ontology, linking cell values to literal constants, implied measurements, or entities in the linked data cloud (existing or new) and discovering or and identifying relations between columns. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Entity Linking; Graphical Models; Linked Data; Machine Learning; Tables,Entity Linking; GraphicaL model; Linked datum; Machine-learning; Tables; Graphic methods; Ontology; Semantics; User interfaces; Semantic Web,"Bizer, C., Lehmann, J., Kobilarov, G., Auer, S., Becker, C., Cyganiak, R., Hellmann, S., Dbpedia - A crystallization point for the web of data (2009) Journal of Web Semantics, 7 (3), pp. 154-165; Cafarella, M.J., Halevy, A.Y., Wang, Z.D., Wu, E., Zhang, Y., Webtables: Exploring the power of tables on the web (2008) PVLDB, 1 (1), pp. 538-549; Ding, L., DiFranzo, D., Graves, A., Michaelis, J.R., Li, X., McGuinness, D.L., Hendler, J.A., Twc data-gov corpus: Incrementally generating linked government data from data.gov (2010) Proc 19th Int.

Many previous path-based methods like PRA and DeepPath suffer from lacking memory components, or stuck in training. Therefore, their performances always rely on well-pretraining. In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement learning based model named by AttnPath, which incorporates LSTM and Graph Attention Mechanism as the memory components. We define two metrics, Mean Selection Rate (MSR) and Mean Replacement Rate (MRR), to quantitatively measure how difficult it is to learn the query relations, and take advantages of them to fine-tune the model under the framework of reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, a novel mechanism of reinforcement learning is proposed by forcing an agent to walk forward every step to avoid the agent stalling at the same entity node constantly. Based on this operation, the proposed model not only can get rid of the pretraining process, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance comparing with the other models. We test our model on FB15K-237 and NELL-995 datasets with different tasks. Extensive experiments show that our model is effective and competitive with many current state-of-the-art methods, and also performs well in practice. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics",,Knowledge representation; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; Reinforcement learning; Attention mechanisms; Knowledge graphs; Memory component; Pre-training; Replacement rates; State-of-the-art methods; State-of-the-art performance; Walk forward; Deep learning,"Bollacker, K., Evans, C., Paritosh, P., Sturge, T., Taylor, J., FreeBase: A collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge (2008) SIGMOD, pp. 1247-1250; Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Garcia-Duran, A., Weston, J., Yakhnenko, O., Translating embeddings for modeling multirelational data (2013) NeurIPS, pp. 2787-2795; Carlson, A., Betteridge, J., Kisiel, B., Settles, B., Hruschka, E.R., Jr., Mitchell, T.M., Toward an architecture for never-ending language learning (2010) AAAI, 5, pp. 1306-1313; Chen, W., Xiong, W., Yan, X., Wang, W., Variational knowledge graph reasoning (2018) NAACL-HLT, pp. 1823-1832; Das, R., Dhuliawala, S., Zaheer, M., Vilnis, L., Durugkar, I., Krishnamurthy, A., Smola, A., McCallum, A., Go for a walk and arrive at the answer: Reasoning over paths in knowledge bases using reinforcement learning (2018) ICLR; Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., Riedel, S., Convolutional 2d knowledge graph embeddings (2018) AAAI, pp. 1811-1818; Dubey, M., Banerjee, D., Chaudhuri, D., Lehmann, J., Strong baselines for simple question answering over knowledge graphs with and without neural networks (2018) ISWC, pp. 108-126; Guu, K., Miller, J., Liang, P., Traversing knowledge graphs in vector space (2015) EMNLP, pp. 318-327; Ji, G., He, S., Xu, L., Liu, K., Zhao, J., Knowledge graph embedding via dynamic mapping matrix (2015) ACL, 1, pp. 687-696; Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., ADaM: A method for stochastic optimization (2015) ICLR; Lao, N., Mitchell, T., Cohen, W.W., Random walk inference and learning in a large scale knowledge base (2011) EMNLP, pp. 529-539; Lin, X.V., Socher, R., Xiong, C., Multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning with reward shaping (2018) EMNLP, pp. 3243-3253; Lin, Y., Liu, Z., Sun, M., Liu, Y., Zhu, X., Learning entity and relation embeddings for knowledge graph completion (2015) AAAI, 15, pp. 2181-2187; Liu, Z., Xiong, C., Sun, M., Liu, Z., Entity-duet neural ranking: Understanding the role of knowledge graph semantics in neural information retrieval (2018) ACL, pp. 2395-2405; Miller, G.A., WordNet: A lexical database for english (1995) Communications of the ACM, 38 (11), pp. 39-41; Neelakantan, A., Roth, B., McCallum, A., Compositional vector space models for knowledge base completion (2015) ACL, pp. 156-166; Shen, Y., Chen, J., Huang, P.-S., Guo, Y., Gao, J., M-walk: Learning to walk over graphs using monte carlo tree search (2018) NeurIPS, pp. 6787-6798; Toutanova, K., Chen, D., Pantel, P., Poon, H., Choudhury, P., Gamon, M., Representing text for joint embedding of text and knowledge bases (2015) EMNLP, pp. 1499-1509; Toutanova, K., Lin, V., Yih, W.-T., Poon, H., Quirk, C., Compositional learning of embeddings for relation paths in knowledge base and text (2016) ACL, 1, pp. 1434-1444; Velickovic, P., Cucurull, G., Casanova, A., Romero, A., Lio, P., Bengio, Y., Graph attention networks (2018) ICLR; Wang, W.Y., Cohen, W.W., Learning first-order logic embeddings via matrix factorization (2016) IJCAI, pp. 2132-2138; Wang, X., Wang, D., Xu, C., He, X., Cao, Y., Chua, T.-S., Explainable reasoning over knowledge graphs for recommendation (2019) AAAI; Wang, Z., Li, L., Zeng, D.D., Chen, Y., Attention-based multi-hop reasoning for knowledge graph (2018) ISI, pp. 211-213; Williams, R.J., Simple statistical gradient-following algorithms for connectionist reinforcement learning (1992) Machine Learning, 8 (3-4), pp. 229-256; Xiong, W., Hoang, T., Wang, W.Y., Deeppath: A reinforcement learning method for knowledge graph reasoning (2017) EMNLP, pp. 564-573; Yang, F., Yang, Z., Cohen, W.W., Differentiable learning of logical rules for knowledge base reasoning (2017) NeurIPS, pp. 2319-2328","Pan, R.; School of Data and Computer Science, China; email: panr@mail.sysu.edu.cn",Apple;ASAPP;et al.;Facebook;Google;salesforce,Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL),"2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019",3 November 2019 through 7 November 2019,,159367,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084320263

This approach has been used in order to avoid the overhead of extracting features from sentences manually. Integer linear programming (ILP) approach has been adopted for selecting sentences to generate the summary based on sentence ranks. This ILP model minimizes the redundancy in the generated summary. We have evaluated our proposed approach on the DUC 2007 dataset and its performance is found to be competitive or better in comparison with state-of-the-art systems. © 2018 IEEE.",Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Integer Linear Programming (ILP); Text summarization; Word Embedding,Computer circuits; Convolution; Distributed computer systems; Electric network parameters; Inductive logic programming (ILP); Machine learning; Neural networks; Robotics; Supervised learning; Text processing; VLSI circuits; Convolutional neural network; Document summarization; Extracting features; Integer Linear Programming; State-of-the-art system; Supervised learning approaches; Text summarization; Word Embedding; Integer programming,"Edmundson, H.P., New methods in automatic extracting (1969) Journal of the ACM (JACM), 16 (2), p. 264285; Dalal, V., Malik, L.G., A survey of extractive and abstractive text summarization techniques (2013) Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology (ICETET), 2013 6th International Conference on, p. 109110. , IEEE; Li, S., Ouyang, Y., Wang, W., Sun, B., Multi-document summarization using support vector regression (2007) Proceedings of DUC, , Citeseer; Cao, Z., Wei, F., Dong, L., Li, S., Zhou, M., Ranking with recursive neural networks and its application to multi-document summarization (2015) AAAI, pp. 2153-2159; Zhang, Y., Er, M.J., Zhao, R., Multi-document extractive summarization using window-based sentence representation (2015) Computational Intelligence, 2015 IEEE Symposium Series on, p. 404410. , IEEE; Pal, A.R., Maiti, P.K., Saha, D., An approach to automatic text summarization using simplified lesk algorithm and wordnet (2013) International Journal of Control Theory and Computer Modeling (IJCTCM), 3; Ouyang, Y., Li, S., Li, W., Developing learning strategies for topicbased summarization (2007) Proceedings of the Sixteenth ACM Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, p. 7986. , ACM; Gillick, D., Favre, B., A scalable global model for summarization (2009) Proceedings of the Workshop on Integer Linear Programming for Natural Langauge Processing, p. 1018. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Li, C., Qian, X., Liu, Y., Using supervised bigram-based ilp for extractive summarization (2013) Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1, p. 10041013. , (Volume 1: Long Papers); LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., Haffner, P., Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition (1998) Proceedings of the IEEE, 86 (11), pp. 2278-2324; Kim, Y., (2014) Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification, , arXiv preprint; Zhang, Y., Er, M.J., Pratama, M., Extractive document summarization based on convolutional neural networks (2016) Industrial Electronics Society, IECON 2016 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE, p. 918922. , IEEE; Gong, Y., Liu, X., Generic text summarization using relevance measure and latent semantic analysis (2001) Proceedings of the 24th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 19-25. , ACM; Wan, X., Yang, J., Multi-document summarization using clusterbased link analysis (2008) Proceedings of the 31st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, p. 299306. , ACM; Erkan, G., Radev, D.R., Lexrank: Graph-based lexical centrality as salience in text summarization (2004) Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 22, pp. 457-479; Kupiec, J., Pedersen, J., Chen, F., A trainable document summarizer (1995) Proceedings of the 18th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, p. 6873. , ACM; Hong, K., Nenkova, A., Improving the estimation of word importance for news multi-document summarization (2014) EACL, p. 712721; Padma Priya, G., Duraiswamy, K., An approach for text summarization using deep learning algorithm (2014) Journal of Computer Science, 10 (1), p. 19; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G.S., Dean, J., Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality (2013) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, p. 31113119; Lin, C.-Y., Rouge: A package for automatic evaluation of summaries (2004) Text Summarization Branches Out: Proceedings of the ACL-04 Workshop, p. 7481; Glorot, X., Bengio, Y., Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks (2010) Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, p. 249256; Galanis, D., Lampouras, G., Androutsopoulos, I., Extractive multidocument summarization with integer linear programming and support vector regression (2012) Proceedings of COLING 2012, p. 911926; Gong, Y., Liu, X., Generic text summarization using relevance measure and latent semantic analysis (2001) Proc. 24th Annu.

The research QA system benefits for the online communities in solving their problems, especially on health-care problems of symptoms. Both question and answer expressions are based on multiple EDUs (Elementary Discourse Units) where each EDU is equivalent to a simple sentence or a clause. The research involves two main problems: how to identify the question types of Why, How, and Request-Diagnosis and how to determine the corresponding answer from the knowledge source after solving the question focuses. Thus, the research applies different machine learning techniques, Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine, to solve the reasoning question type identification. The knowledge source contains several symptom-treatment vector pairs and several cause-effect vector pairs. Therefore, we propose clustering symptoms/problems of the knowledge source before determining an answer based on top-down levels of determining similarity scores between a web board question and the knowledge source. The research achieves 83% correctness of the answer determination with potentially saving amounts of search time. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",How question; Problem solving; Similarity score; Why question,Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Online systems; How question; Knowledge sources; Machine learning techniques; On-line communities; Question answering systems; Question focus; Similarity scores; Why question; Problem solving,"Aloise, D., Deshpande, A., Hansen, P., Popat, P., NP-hardness of Euclidean sum of squares clustering (2009) Mach.

Considering the lack of information about pragmatic meaning, creating sound heuristics automatically out of capability descriptions asks too much of modern reasoning algorithms. Most approaches use semantics in oder to enable the reasoner to improve Word-sense disambiguation in their ontology matching tasks. As semantics are meant to be shared, the information is context independent and quite general. I postulate that context-dependent meaning can play an important role in describing the meaning of concepts used, as some meaning might change with the changes in context. The proposed thesis creates context-dependent heuristics by combining expert knowledge with machine learning. The PhD has the goal of structuring descriptions with a concept introduced in linguistics, introducing a description of domain knowledge and contextual information and thereby enable the automatic creation of context-dependent heuristics. Choosing from the many improvement points of agent planning, this work focuses on the improvement of capability descriptions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Automatic creations; Capability description; Context independent; Contextual information; Reasoning algorithms; Search Algorithms; Service compositions; Word Sense Disambiguation; Multi agent systems,"Bencomo, N., Cavallaro, L., Sawyer, P., Sykes, D., Issarny, V., (2012) Satisfying Requirements for Pervasive Service Compositions, , ACM, Innsbruck; Bouquet, P., Giunchiglia, F., (2003) C-owl: Contextualizing Ontologies; Chen, S., Wu, H., Han, X., Xiao, L., Multi-step truncated q-learning algorithm (2005) Machine Learning, pp. 18-21; Fahndrich, J., Ahrndt, S., Towards self-explaining agents (2013) PAAMS 2013; Fern, A., Khardon, R., Tadepalli, P., The first learning track of the international planning competition (2011) Machine Learning, 84 (1-2), pp. 81-107; Ghidini, C., Giunchiglia, F., Local models semantics, or contextual reasoning = locality + compatibility (2001) Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1-41; Giunchiglia, Maltese, Dutta, Domains and contest: Fiest stepes towards managing diversitz in knowledge (2012) Journal Fo Web Semantics, 12-13, pp. 53-63; Goddard, C., (2008) Cross-linguistic Semantics, , John Benjamins Pub.

They are already being used extensively and will spread their wings to newer horizons shortly. The basic model of Chatbots is to interact with the user to answer their questions using various modes like text messages, voice replies, or any other predefined suitable interface. This paper discusses the development of a Chatbot for the college, Prasad V Potluri Siddhartha Institute of technology, to answer various questions related to the college like the facilities, procedures, policies, etc. This is a web-based software application implemented using Flask framework. This model is designed to capture text inputs from the user through a console and outputs the response in text format using machine learning concepts. A retrieval approach is implemented to process the input and to respond with an appropriate answer using logic adapters. The performance of this model is analyzed using a questionnaire that uses various parameters like performance, humanity, effect, and accessibility. This paper presents the overall approach used to design the Chatbot and compares the web application as-is study with the to-be website when the Chatbot is incorporated. The web application along with the Chatbot showed a 20% improvement in performance and 5% increase in accessibility by analyzing the performance metrics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Chatbot; Flask framework; Machine learning; Retrieval approach,,"Schachner, T., Keller, R., von Wangenheim, F., Artificial intelligence-based conversational agents for chronic conditions: Systematic literature review (2020) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 22 (9). , https://doi.org/10.2196/20701; Xu, A., Liu, Z., Guo, Y., Sinha, V., Akkiraju, R., A new chatbot for customer service on social media (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems—CHI ’17, pp. 3506-3510. , (pp; Pawar, H., Prabhu, P., Yadav, A., Mendonca, V., Lemos, J., College enquiry chatbot using knowledge in database.

The aim of the work reported in this paper was to design and implement an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) having a massive speedup of a cortical algorithm, as compared with a CPU baseline. This ASIC is designed to implement a scaled-down version of Sparsey, an algorithm based on structural and functional properties of the brain's cortex. The design was benchmarked on the Short Message Service (SMS) spam collection dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. It was found that the synthesis area and power consumption of a single column (i.e., mac or PE) are 0.122 mm2 and 5.15 mW using 45 nm technology and 0.171 mm2 and 7.94 mW using 65 nm technology. The processing time for a single frame was 3.075 μs (learning) and 0.675 μs (recognition). The performance speedup in learning and recognition modes of ASIC implementation was 203× and 843× times that of software implementation on a CPU based platform. © 2016 IEEE.",Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC); cortical processor; spam; sparse distributed code (SDC),Character recognition; Integrated circuit design; Machine learning; Nanotechnology; Programmable logic controllers; Conventional algorithms; cortical processor; Distributed codes; Functional properties; Short message services; Software implementation; spam; UCI machine learning repository; Application specific integrated circuits,"Hidalgo, J.M.G., Almeida, T.A., Yamakami, A., On the validity of a new sms spam collection (2012) Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), 2012 11th International Conference on, pp. 240-245. , Boca Raton, FL; Rinkus, G.J., (1996) A Combinatorial Neural Network Exhibiting Episodic and Semantic Memory Properties for Spatiotemporal Patterns, , Ph.D. dissertation, Dept.

It is necessary to organize this data for exploitation and extraction of useful information. Text classification based on the topic is one of the efficient solutions to this problem. Efficient algorithms are applied for text classification if they address high dimensional data. In this paper, a novel neural network classifier is adapted to classify the texts and compared to some similar techniques. To this end, firstly preprocessing is conducted on the words, which includes five steps. After that, the feature extraction phase is applied consisting of three steps, with the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) method used for dimensionality reduction. Finally, a supervised learning method, namely the Multi-Level Fuzzy min-max neural network classifier (MLF), is used for text classification. The simulation results of the experiments, compared to three other principle methods, indicate that MLF method has a high accuracy of 94% for the Reuters-21578 dataset and 95% for the 20 newsgroup dataset. In addition, the execution time of the proposed method is less than other supervised learning algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",Machine Learning; Multi-level Fuzzy Neural Network; Text Classification; Text Mining,Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Extraction; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Supervised learning; Text processing; Dimensionality reduction; Fuzzy min-max neural networks; High dimensional data; Multilevels; Principle component analysis; Supervised learning methods; Text classification; Text mining; Classification (of information),"Hu, X., Liu, H., Text analytics in social media (2012) Mining Text Data, pp. 385-414. , Springer; Shah, F., Patel, V., A review on feature selection and feature extraction for text classification (2016) International Conference on Wireless Communications, Signal Processing and Networking (WiSPNET, pp. 2264-2268; Zhao, M.-H., Chen, Y.-Z., Liu, D.-R., Li, J., The Application of Optimized Fuzzy Decision Trees in Business Intelligence, , International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Aug2006; Wang, L., Li, L., Automatic text classification based on hidden markov model and support vector machine The Eighth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA), China, pp. 217-224. , Jul2013; Ding, W., Yu, S., Wang, Q., Yu, J., Guo, Q., A novel naive Bayesian text classifier (2008) Information Processing (ISIP, , May; Vega, L., Mendez-Vazquez, A., Dynamic neural networks for text classification (2016) Computational Intelligence and Applications (ICCIA) 2016 International Conference on, , Aug; Wang, L., Zhao, X., Improved knn classification algorithms research in text categorization (2012) Consumer Electronics, Communications and Networks (CECNet) 2012 2nd International Conference on, , April; Bidi, N., Elberrichi, Z., Feature selection for text classification using genetic algorithms (2016) Modelling, Identification and Control (ICMIC) 2016 8th International Conference on, , Nov; Hong, S.S., Lee, W., Han, M.M., The feature selection method based on genetic algorithm for efficient of text clustering and text classification (2015) Int.

We still have more books and writings than sound and image data. This predominance engages the need for engineers in the field of computer science to enhance the comprehension of text by machines, and the capacity to retrieve or create information out of text data. Semantics is the study of the relationship between the meaning of signs in a particular language. The understanding of the different meaning of textual elements present in a sentence gives us the capacity to interpret text and give it a logical meaning. We have to note that in the absence of a link between those different meanings, a complete sentence cannot be formed and no meaning can, therefore, be extracted. Our goal is to make possible for a machine to grasp those meanings along with the semantic relationships and establish a knowledge, and once this knowledge is established into semantic sequences, converting it into a visual representation such as an image could deeply improve our capacity of comprehension of text and help individuals having trouble understanding a text. To achieve this, we decided to first define a text parsing and summarization technique using word embeddings and engage into a text to image conversion using a GAN. The logic behind this implementation is to give the computer the ability to grasp semantic sequences and define sequences of illustrations based on the text provided. © 2020 Owner/Author.",Att-GAN; Conversion; DCGAN; Discriminator; Generator; Image; LSTM; Machine learning; Neural networks; Regression; Semantics parsing; Sequences; Text; Text mining,Image enhancement; Syntactics; Graphical representations; Image conversion; Image data; Information elements; Semantic relationships; Text data; Text parsing; Visual representations; Semantics,"Bao, J.-P., Shen, J.-Y., Liu, X.-D., Liu, H.-Y., Zhang, X.-D., (2004) Semantic Sequence Kin: A Method of Document Copy Detection, , Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg; Jia, R., Liang, P., (2016) Data Recombination for Neural Semantic Parsing, , 11 Jun; Radford, A., Metz, L., Chintala, S., (2016) Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, , 7 Jan; Xu, T., Zhang, P., Huang, Q., Zhang, H., Gan, Z., Huang, X., He, X., (2017) AttnGAN: Fine-Grained Text to Image Generation with Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks, , 28 Nov",,University of South Florida,Association for Computing Machinery,"2020 ACM Southeast Conference, ACMSE 2020",2 April 2020 through 4 April 2020,,160113,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086180415

But they only focus on the direct relationship between entities and ignore the importance of the semantic features of entity types. In addition, a large amount of unstructured text can effectively supplement the semantic information of the Knowledge Graph (KG). In order to solve the problem of scattered knowledge and lack of relationships in the KG, we propose a neural network model which is based on attention mechanism. The model combines the semantic information and the entity type captured by the attention layer to predict the link of tripe. We performed link prediction tasks on public datasets, and under the premise of sufficient data sources, also confirmed that our method is innovative and has research value. © 2020 IEEE.",Attention; Knowledge Graph; Transformers,Big data; Embeddings; Information analysis; Machine learning; Semantics; Attention mechanisms; Embedding method; Knowledge graphs; Low-dimensional spaces; Neural network model; Semantic features; Semantic information; Unstructured texts; Knowledge representation,"Bordes, A., Usunier, N., García-Durán, A., Translating embeddings for modeling multi relational data[c] (2013) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 26: 27thAnnual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2787-2795; Wang, Z., Zhang, J., Feng, J., Knowledge graph embedding by translating on hyper-planes[c] (2014) Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1112-1119; Lin, Y., Liu, Z., Sun, M., Learning entity and relation embeddings for knowledge graph completion[c] (2015) Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 2181-2187; Wang, Z., Zhang, J., Feng, J., Knowledge graph and text jointly embedding[c] (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 1591-1601; Xie, R., Liu, Z., Jia, J., Representation learning of knowledge graphs with entity descriptions[c] (2016) Proceedings of the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 2659-2665; Xu, J., Qiu, X., Chen, K., Knowledge graph representation with jointly structural and textual encoding[c] (2017) Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1318-1324; Fan, M., Zhou, Q., Abel, A., Probabilistic Belief Embedding for Knowledge Base Completion[J]; Shi, B., Weninger, T., (2017) Open-World Knowledge Graph Completion[J]; Devlin, J., Chang, M.W., Lee, K., BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language; Hu, Z., Huang, P., Deng, Y., Entity hierarchy embedding[c] (2015) Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing, pp. 1292-1300; Gan, Z., Cheng, Y., Kholy, A.E., Li, L., Liu, J., Gao, J., (2019) Multistep Reasoning Via Recurrent Dual Attention for Visual Dialog; Sukhbaatar, S., Szlam, A., Weston, J., Fergus, R., End-to-end memory networks (2015) Proceedings of Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 28, pp. 2440-2448",,,IEEE,"2nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Big Data and Business Intelligence, MLBDBI 2020",23 October 2020 through 25 October 2020,,167501,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102554364

Predictors can be combined with other predictors to form complex decoding tasks. SGNMT implements a number of search strategies for traversing the space spanned by the predictors which are appropriate for different predictor constellations. Adding new predictors or decoding strategies is particularly easy, making it a very efficient tool for prototyping new research ideas.

Therefore, math content processing presents some of the same challenges faced in natural language processing (NLP), such as math disambiguation and math semantics determination. These challenges must be surmounted to enable more effective math knowledge management, math knowledge discovery, automated presentation-to-computation (P2C) conversion, and automated math reasoning. To meet this goal, considerable math language processing (MLP) technology is needed. This project aims to advance MLP by developing (1) a sophisticated part-of-math (POM) tagger, (2) math-sense disambiguation techniques along with supporting Machine-Learning (ML) based MLP algorithms, and (3) semantics extraction from, and enrichment of, math expressions. Specifically, the project first created an evolving tagset for math terms and expressions, and is developing a general-purpose POM tagger. The tagger works in several scans and interacts with other MLP algorithms that will be developed in this project. In the first scan of an input math document, each math term and some sub-expressions are tagged with two kinds of tags. The 1st kind consists of definite tags (such as operation, relation, numerator, etc.) that the tagger is certain of. The 2nd kind consists of alternative, tentative features (including alternative roles and meanings) drawn from a knowledge base that has been developed for this project. The 2nd and 3rd scan will, in conjunction with some NLP/MLbased algorithms, select the right features from among those alternative features, disambiguate the terms, group subsequences of terms into unambiguous sub-expressions and tag them, and thus derive definite unambiguous semantics of math terms and expressions. The NLP/MLbased algorithms needed for this work will be another part of this project. These include math topic modeling, math context modeling, math document classification (into various standard areas of math), and definitionharvesting algorithms. The project will create significant new concepts and techniques that will advance knowledge in two respects. First, the tagger, math disambiguation techniques, and NLP/ML-based algorithms, though they correspond to NLP and ML counterparts, will be quite novel because math expressions are radically different from natural language. Second, the project outcomes will enable the development of new advanced applications such as: (1) techniques for computer-aided semantic enrichment of digital math libraries; (2) automated P2C conversion of math expressions from natural form to (i) a machine-computable form and (ii) a formal form suitable for automated reasoning; (3) math questionanswering capabilities at the manuscript level and collection level; (4) richer math UIs; and (5) more accurate math optical character recognition. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,Automation; Character recognition; Digital libraries; Information retrieval systems; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Natural language processing systems; Optical character recognition; Project management; Semantics; Advanced applications; Automated reasoning; Document Classification; Language processing; Mathematical literature; Question Answering; Semantic enrichment; Semantics extractions; Computational linguistics,"Agirre, E., Lopez de Lacalle, A., Soroa, A., Knowledge-based WSD on specific domains: Performing better than generic supervised WSD (2009) IJCAI, pp. 1501-1506; Anca, S., (2009) Natural language and mathematics processing for applicable theorem search, , Master’s thesis, Jacobs University Bremen; Anderson, R.H., Two-dimensional mathematical notation (1977) Syntactic Pattern Recognition, Applications, pp. 174-177. , Fu, K.S.

Chien J.-T.,7202435221;,Deep Bayesian Multimedia Learning,2020,MM 2020 - Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia,,,,4791,4793,,3,10.1145/3394171.3418545,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100923816&doi=10.1145%2f3394171.3418545&partnerID=40&md5=7cd4e36901027bd4ea3c8cd5db1b6089,"Deep learning has been successfully developed as a complicated learning process from source inputs to target outputs in presence of multimedia environments. The inference or optimization is performed over an assumed deterministic model with deep structure. A wide range of temporal and spatial data in language and vision are treated as the inputs or outputs to build such a domain mapping for multimedia applications. A systematic and elaborate transfer is required to meet the mapping between source and target domains. Also, the semantic structure in natural language and computer vision may not be well represented or trained in mathematical logic or computer programs. The distribution function in discrete or continuous latent variable model for words, sentences, images or videos may not be properly decomposed or estimated. The system robustness to heterogeneous environments may not be assured. This tutorial addresses the fundamentals and advances in statistical models and neural networks for domain mapping, and presents a series of deep Bayesian solutions including variational Bayes, sampling method, Bayesian neural network, variational auto-encoder (VAE), stochastic recurrent neural network, sequence-to-sequence model, attention mechanism, end-to-end network, stochastic temporal convolutional network, temporal difference VAE, normalizing flow and neural ordinary differential equation. Enhancing the prior/posterior representation is addressed in different latent variable models. We illustrate how these models are connected and why they work for a variety of applications on complex patterns in language and vision. The word, sentence and image embeddings are merged with semantic constraint or structural information. Bayesian learning is formulated in the optimization procedure where the posterior collapse is tackled. An informative latent space is trained to incorporate deep Bayesian learning in various information systems. © 2020 Owner/Author.",Bayesian learning; computer vision; deep learning; domain mapping; multimedia; natural language processing; sequential learning,Bayesian networks; Convolutional neural networks; Distribution functions; Learning systems; Mapping; Ordinary differential equations; Sampling; Semantics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Bayesian neural networks; Convolutional networks; Heterogeneous environments; Latent variable modeling; Latent variable models; Multimedia applications; Optimization procedures; Stochastic recurrent neural network; Recurrent neural networks,"Aksan, E., Hilliges, O., STCN: Stochastic temporal convolutional networks (2019) Proc.

Moruzzi C.,57203223468;,On the relevance of understanding for creativity,2021,AISB Convention 2021: Communication and Conversations,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109099229&partnerID=40&md5=dd448a0a0c8c2bf9ab3385d371c1f783,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications help humans accomplish many everyday tasks and we are increasingly in contact with its always improving technologies. However, research in AI has been hindered by biases and misconceptions that concern its possibilities and by the uncertainty and lack of clarity in respect to what does it mean for a machine to ‘learn’ or to ‘understand’. The aim of this paper is to discuss human and artificial understanding and to assess how state-of-the-art research fares in respect to the development of artificial systems capable of understanding. To do that, I first consider four notions that can help us in having a richer vision of what understanding amounts to: knowledge, grasp, problem-solving, and context sensitivity. In the central section of the paper, I identify two kinds of understanding that are necessary for creativity, a competence that current research in AI strives to reproduce in artificial systems. I then, discuss the impressive, but not completely satisfactory, achievements of Natural Language Processing, a branch of AI that is moving towards gaining a higher level of understanding. I close the paper by arguing how the current program of neurosymbolic AI is showing promising results in the progress toward achieving the desired level of understanding and creativity in machines. This program takes inspiration from the dual-model of the human mind proposed by Daniel Kahneman in his bestselling work Thinking Fast and Slow and it parallels the mechanisms that are necessary to develop not only a context-sensitive understanding, but also creative capabilities. © 2021 AISB Convention 2021: Communication and Conversations.

We have built a prototype, which 1) applies text classification and text mining methods on job vacancy announcements to match jobs and their required skills; 2) predicts the quality of videos; and 3) creates an open educational video recommender system to suggest personalized learning content to learners. For the first evaluation of this prototype we focused on the area of data science related jobs. Our prototype was evaluated by in-depth, semi-structured interviews. 15 subject matter experts provided feedback to assess how our recommender prototype performs in terms of its objectives, logic, and contribution to learning. More than 250 videos were recommended, and 82.8% of these recommendations were treated as useful by the interviewees. Moreover, interviews revealed that our personalized video recommender system, has the potential to improve the learning experience. © 2020 IEEE.",Educational recommender system; Lifelong learning; Machine learning; OER; Open educational resource; Text classification; Text mining; Video recommender system,Classification (of information); Data Science; Employment; Recommender systems; Text mining; Educational videos; Learning experiences; Personalized learning; Personalized video; Semi structured interviews; Skill requirements; Subject matter experts; Text classification; Learning systems,"Colombo, E., Mercorio, F., Mezzanzanica, M., (2018) Applying Machine Learning Tools on Web Vacancies for Labour Market and Skill Analysis; Wowczko, I., Skills and vacancy analysis with data mining techniques (2015) Informatics, 2 (4), pp. 31-49. , Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute; McGill, M.M., Defining the expectation gap: A comparison of industry needs and existing game development curriculum (2009) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Foundations of Digital Games, pp. 129-136; Khobreh, M., Ansari, F., Fathi, M., Vas, R., Mol, S.T., Berkers, H.A., Varga, K., An ontology-based approach for the semantic representation of job knowledge (2015) Ieee Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, 4 (3), pp. 462-473; Djumalieva, J., Sleeman, C., An open and data-driven taxonomy of skills extracted from online job adverts (2018) Developing Skills in a Changing World of Work: Concepts, Measurement and Data Applied in Regional and Local Labour Market Monitoring across Europe, p. 425; Kanwar, A., Mishra, S., (2018) Global Trends in Oer: What Is the Future?; Ha, K.-H., Niemann, K., Schwertel, U., Holtkamp, P., Pirkkalainen, H., Boerner, D., Kalz, M., Pappa, D., A novel approach towards skill-based search and services of open educational resources (2011) Research Conference on Metadata and Semantic Research, pp. 312-323. , Springer; Sun, G., Cui, T., Xu, D., Shen, J., Chen, S., A heuristic approach for new-item cold start problem in recommendation of micro open education resources (2018) International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, pp. 212-222. , Springer; Ruiz-Iniesta, A., Jimenez-Diaz, G., Gomez-Albarran, M., A se-mantically enriched context-Aware oer recommendation strategy and its application to a computer science oer repository (2014) Ieee Transactions on Education, 57 (4), pp. 255-260; Chicaiza, J., Piedra, N., Lopez-Vargas, J., Tovar-Caro, E., A user profile definition in context of recommendation of open educational resources.

Nevertheless, economic incentives have resulted in an arms race, where fraudsters develop automated solvers and, in turn, captcha services tweak their design to break the solvers. Recent work, however, presented a generic attack that can be applied to any text-based captcha scheme. Fittingly, Google recently unveiled the latest version of reCaptcha. The goal of their new system is twofold, to minimize the effort for legitimate users, while requiring tasks that are more challenging to computers than text recognition. ReCaptcha is driven by an ""advanced risk analysis system"" that evaluates requests and selects the difficulty of the captcha that will be returned. Users may be required to click in a checkbox, or solve a challenge by identifying images with similar content. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of reCaptcha, and explore how the risk analysis process is influenced by each aspect of the request. Through extensive experimentation, we identify flaws that allow adversaries to effortlessly influence the risk analysis, bypass restrictions, and deploy large-scale attacks. Subsequently, we design a novel low-cost attack that leverages deep learning technologies for the semantic annotation of images. Our system is extremely effective, automatically solving 70.78% of the image reCaptcha challenges, while requiring only 19 seconds per challenge. We also apply our attack to the Facebook image captcha and achieve an accuracy of 83.5%. Based on our experimental findings, we propose a series of safeguards and modifications for impacting the scalability and accuracy of our attacks. Overall, while our study focuses on reCaptcha, our findings have wide implications, as the semantic information conveyed via images is increasingly within the realm of automated reasoning, the future of captchas relies on the exploration of novel directions. © 2016 IEEE.",,Character recognition; Electronic mail filters; Network security; Risk assessment; Semantics; Analysis process; Automated reasoning; Economic incentive; Large-scale attacks; Legitimate users; Risk analysis systems; Semantic annotations; Semantic information; Risk analysis,"Von Ahn, L., Blum, M., Hopper, N.J., Langford, J., CAPTCHA: Using hard ai problems for security EUROCRYPT ?03; Foley, M., Prove you?re human fetishizing material embodiment and immaterial labor in information networks (2014) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 31 (5), pp. 365-379; Jeremy, E., Douceur, J.R., Howell, J., Sault, J., Asirra: A captcha that exploits interest-Aligned manual image categorization CCS ?07; CAPTCHAs Have Negative Impact on Web Traffic and Leads, , http://www.distilnetworks.com/distil-networks-study-captchas-negative-impact-on-web-Traffic/, Distil Networks; Motoyama, M., Levchenko, K., Kanich, C., McCoy, D., Voelker, G.M., Savage, S., Re: Captchas: Understanding captcha-solving services in an economic context USENIX Security ?10; Bursztein, E., Aigrain, J., Moscicki, A., Mitchell, J.C., The end is nigh: Generic solving of text-based CAPTCHAs USENIX WOOT ?14; Mowery, K., Shacham, H., Pixel perfect: Fingerprinting canvas in html5 W2SP ?12; Zhu, B.B., Yan, J., Li, Q., Yang, C., Liu, J., Xu, N., Yi, M., Cai, K., Attacks and design of image recognition CAPTCHAs CCS ?10; Von Ahn, L., Maurer, B., McMillen, C., Abraham, D., Blum, M., ReCAPTCHA: Human-based character recognition via web security measures (2008) Science, 321 (5895); Are You A Robot?

We demonstrate that GPT-3, a state-of-the-art contextual language model, captures persistent Muslim-violence bias. We probe GPT-3 in various ways, including prompt completion, analogical reasoning, and story generation, to understand this anti-Muslim bias, demonstrating that it appears consistently and creatively in different uses of the model and that it is severe even compared to biases about other religious groups. For instance, Muslim is analogized to terrorist in 23% of test cases, while Jewish is mapped to its most common stereotype, money, in 5% of test cases. We quantify the positive distraction needed to overcome this bias with adversarial text prompts, and find that use of the most positive 6 adjectives reduces violent completions for Muslims from 66% to 20%, but which is still higher than for other religious groups. © 2021 ACM.",bias; ethics; language models; machine learning; stereotypes,Computational linguistics; Philosophical aspects; Analogical reasoning; Language model; Religious groups; State of the art; Story generations; Test case; Artificial intelligence,"Abid, A., Abdalla, A., Abid, A., Khan, D., Alfozan, A., Zou, J., (2019) Gradio: Hassle-free Sharing and Testing of Ml Models in the Wild., , 2019; Bolukbasi, T., Chang, K., Zou, J.Y., Saligrama, V., Kalai, A.T., Man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker?

Social media, where users share their personal experiences of medication effects, have been recommended as an alternative data source of gathering signal information of suspected medication effects. To discover potential medication-effect relations from Twitter data, we devised a method employing analogical reasoning with neural embedding of Twitter text. The process involves learning the neural embedding from unlabeled tweets and performing vector arithmetic, making it obscure to understand how an inferred relation is derived. To make the process understandable and interpretable and to facilitate the decision making on accepting or rejecting any inferred medication-effect relations, we added explanation(s) to each step of the process. An example of inferred relation is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in explaining how the result of each step is derived. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Analogical reasoning; Explainable machine learning; Medication effects; Pharmacovigilance; Social media,Decision making; Embeddings; Health care; Knowledge representation; Medical computing; Social networking (online); Analogical reasoning; Data-source; Medication effects; Personal experience; Pharmacovigilance; Signal information; Social media; Social media datum; Medical information systems,"Pirmohamed, M., Adverse drug reactions as cause of admission to hospital: Prospective analysis of 18 820 patients (2004) BMJ, 329 (7456), pp. 15-19; Lazarou, J., Pomeranz, B.H., Corey, P.N., Incidence of adverse drug reactions in hospitalized patients: A meta-analysis of prospective studies (1998) JAMA, 279 (15), pp. 1200-1205; Moore, T.J., Cohen, M.R., Furberg, C.D., Serious adverse drug events reported to the Food and Drug Administration, 1998–2005 (2007) Arch.

There are different malware types such as key loggers, logic bomb, viruses, rootkits, Trojans, spywares, ransom wares, worms, backdoors, bots, etc. Metamorphic malwares are the malware type which can undergo change at runtime such that they change their code and signature's to bypass the security. Malware's are written in such a way that they get mutated frequently but the original algorithm remains the same. To distinguish a malware, systems like conduct based location, signature based identification and machine learning based procedures are utilized. The mark based discovery framework falls flat in the event that it experiences another obscure malware. In the event of conduct based identification framework, if the antivirus program distinguishes any odd conduct over web then it will produce alert flag, yet there is a high false positive rate as it is inclined to arrange kind records as malware. Machine learning methodology is proposed to detect the malware where feature extraction is based on opcodes in the executable file of the malware. Opcodes of the malware can be extracted into a text file using disassemblers like IDA pro. As success rate of a machine learning algorithm depends on correctness of the features extracted, a robust approach to extract the features is proposed. This model is expected to give success rate of more than 96% in detection of malware. © 2017 IEEE.",Feature extraction; Machine learning; Malware; Metamorphic; Opcodes,Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Computer viruses; Computer worms; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Microcomputers; Anti-virus programs; Discovery frameworks; False positive rates; Metamorphic; Metamorphic malware; Opcodes; Original algorithms; Robust approaches; Malware,"Oderici, A.H., Chi-Squared distance and metamorphic virus detection (2013) Journal of Computer Virology and Hacking Techniques, pp. 1-14. , Stamp M.

For example, large-scale artificial neural networks (popularly called deep learning) now represent the state-of-the art in a wide and ever-increasing range of video/image/audio/text recognition problems. However, the growth in data sets and network complexities have led to deep learning becoming one of the most challenging workloads across the computing spectrum. We posit that approximate computing can play a key role in the quest for energy-efficient neuromorphic systems. We show how the principles of approximate computing can be applied to the design of neuromorphic systems at various layers of the computing stack. At the algorithm level, we present techniques to significantly scale down the computational requirements of a neural network with minimal impact on its accuracy. At the circuit level, we show how approximate logic and memory can be used to implement neurons and synapses in an energy-efficient manner, while still meeting accuracy requirements. A fundamental limitation to the efficiency of neuromorphic computing in traditional implementations (software and custom hardware alike) is the mismatch between neuromorphic algorithms and the underlying computing models such as von Neumann architecture and Boolean logic. To overcome this limitation, we describe how emerging spintronic devices can offer highly efficient, approximate realization of the building blocks of neuromorphic computing systems. © 2016 ACM.",,Algorithms; Computation theory; Computer aided design; Energy efficiency; Inference engines; Logic circuits; Neural networks; Reconfigurable hardware; Pulse analyzing circuits; Circuits and systems; Computational requirements; Fundamental limitations; Network complexity; Neumann architecture; Neuromorphic computing; Neuromorphic systems; Spintronic device; Computer circuits,"Krizhevsky, A., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Proc.

We address the problem of finding vector space embeddings for theories in the Description Logic EL++that are also models of the TBox. To find such embeddings, we define an optimization problem that characterizes the model-theoretic semantics of the operators in EL++within Rn, thereby solving the problem of finding an interpretation function for an EL++theory given a particular domain ∆. Our approach is mainly relevant to large EL++theories and knowledge bases such as the ontologies and knowledge graphs used in the life sciences.

The first project is related to teaching in the field of nuclear physics and nuclear power engineering. The second project is related to training in computer science and programming. The possibility of using the DLLearner software in conjunction with the Apache Jena Reasoners in order to refine the ontologies that are designed on the basis of the SROIQ(D) description logic is shown. A software agent for the context-sensitive searching for new knowledge in the WWW has been developed as a toolkit for ontologies enrichment. The binary Pareto relation and Levenshtein metrics are used in order to evaluate the measure of compliance of the found content concerning a specific domain. It allows the knowledge engineer to calculate the measure of the proximity of an arbitrary network resource about classes and objects of specific knowledge graphs. The suggested software solutions are based on cloud computing using DBaaS and PaaS service models to ensure the scalability of data warehouses and network services. Examples of applying the software and technologies under discuss are given. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

The monthly active usage of major social media platform such as Facebook is 2.32 billion monthly active users (MAU) and of Twitter is 126 million; hence, the market for understanding the customer sentiment through social media can be a game changer for a company and can help define the success of the company in the future. If the sentiments of the users are not captured correctly, it could lead to catastrophic failure of the product and hamper company’s reputation. Existing systems require a lot of manual tasks such as customer surveys, aggregating the sentiments then generating excel reports which are not very interactive and require a lot of time to gather results. These reports also do not show real-time data. People express their opinion on social media. Companies can use such platforms to capture honest and transparent opinions of the consumers. The cognitive service evaluates tweet texts and returns a sentiment score for each text, ranging from 0 (negative) to 1 (positive). This capability is useful for detecting positive and negative sentiments in social media such as Facebook, Twitter, customer reviews, and discussion forums. The machine learning model used by the cognitive service helps determine sentiment using data provided by the user. This feedback can allow the company to know the acceptance of the product in prototype stages and can use the same to modify the product as per the customer feedback before making the product generally available. The implementation environment uses Azure services (Logic apps, Cognitive Services, SQL Database, App Services) with Power BI used to generate real-time business intelligent reports to capture customer sentiment, and a Windows 10 workstation can be used to access all these services. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Azure services; Business intelligent; Customer sentiments; Machine learning model,,"Jindal, N., Liu, B., (2008) Opinion Spam and Analysis, in Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference On, Web Search and Data Mining, WSDM ’08, pp. 219-230. , ACM, New York, ), pp; Mukherjee, A., Liu, B., Glance, N., (2012) Spotting Fake Reviewer Groups in Consumer Reviews, in Proceedings of the 21St, International Conference on World Wide Web, WWW ’12, pp. 191-200. , ACM, New York, ), pp; Pang, B., Lee, L., A sentimental education: Sentiment analysis using subjectivity summariza-tion based on minimum cuts Proceedings of the 42Nd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL ’04, p. 2004. , Association for Computational Linguistics, Stroudsburg; Turney, P.D., (2002) Thumbs up Or Thumbs Down?

Arts and Humanities are sciences that are mainly based on the interpretation of cultural objects such as texts, paintings and works of arts, or historical/ethnological remains and monuments. Such objects are often unique, very valuable, fragile, irreplaceable and locally preserved in scientific collections at museums, in archives, or in urban and historic areas. Archives, museums and other cultural institutions do not simply conserve these objects. They also manage a large of documentation on them in the form of photo collections, expertise, records, scientific studies and analyses. Both the objects themselves as well as the supplementary documentation are often accessible only through physical contact with users. Duplicates such as text documents (e.g., critical editions), or image documents (facsimiles, photographs) on paper are extremely expensive in terms of manpower, know-how and printing costs, and often these expenses cannot be justified for a small scientific audience. Electronic formats for object documentation might alleviate this access problem. Numerous initiatives have been started and supported to highlight and investigate a variety of challenges that museums and other culture-historical institutions are facing in an increasingly digital, media saturated landscape. However, full knowledge and usage of this material are severely impeded by access problems, due to the lack of appropriate content-based search and retrieval aids that help users to find what they really need even when electronically and digitized copies are available. Preserving contents does not consist in simply storing them, but in actively transforming them to adapt them technically and keep them intelligible. Moreover, many informal and non-institutional contacts between cultural archives constitute specific professional communities which today, however, still lack effective and efficient technological support for cooperative and collaborative knowledge working. The creation of digital libraries, enhanced by annotation collaboratory facilities, is the technological response to bundle documents, interpretation knowledge, work processes and an expert network in a very flexible working environment. Object and document collections in the Arts and Humanities always represent work in progress. The inventory at cultural institutions is growing steadily due to donations, acquisitions, and by virtue of their own daily scientific and conservation services. These additions must be incorporated into the existing collections but often space difficulties, problems of scientific know-how and lack of personnel have to be dealt with. Professionals and experts classify, analyze, assess and expose or edit these objects and documents. Highly qualified external specialists are frequently difficult to locate, if they are not part of a scholarly network. Internal experts are often overburdened with routine work in times of small cultural budgets and can only invest time sporadically and intermittently in integrating new inventories. Many scientific members of cultural institutions have temporary contracts and leave after a few years, taking with them a great part of the accumulated know-how. The intrinsic nature of the document processing procedures supporting the progressive work on historic material, as outlined in this introduction, poses several constraints that require solutions specifically tailored to the tasks mentioned above. Over the years, Intelligent Systems are becoming valuable working instruments for researchers involved in humanistic sciences. The new challenge is now to provide these people with tools that are able to facilitate the fruition and investigation of the cultural heritage, so that even non-experts or communities of researchers may use up-to-date tools for both their personal work and for collaborative purposes. Technologically, the World Wide Web can serve both as a standard communication platform for such communities and as a gateway for document-centered digital library applications. Yet, while the Web may solve the problem of the diffusion and access of this material in its digital form, new automated tools are needed to allow a more intelligent processing and a personalized utilization of this knowledge. According to the situation previously described, besides the effectiveness and the efficiency of such solutions, such automatic tools must be able to cope with situations in which the continuous growth of the available material and knowledge is a fundamental and unavoidable issue. Hence, there is the need for a system component that is able to build incrementally upon previously acquired knowledge through diverse reasoning mechanisms. Specifically, the availability of systems that can automatically identify and separate document classes and meaningful parts inside them would alleviate experts from the need to accomplish low-level tasks, thus allowing them to focus on more intellectual interpretation-intensive tasks. For such systems to be successful in a real operating environment, however, their behavior and results must be comprehensible to human experts, which can happen only when symbolic representations are used. The choice of these symbolic mechanisms, which resemble closely the human way of reasoning, also allows a more direct comprehension and control of the knowledge synthesized at every step of the process. In the talk, different experiences and projects in the cultural heritage application domain are briefly presented and the symbolic Machine Learning approaches, developed by the LACAM Lab. of the Department of Computer Science of the University of Bari, are presented. Since the 90's Document Engineering has been one of the elective application domains for the research group working in the field of Conceptual Learning, Inductive Logic Programming and Statistical Relational Learning. The research projects ([1], [2], [3], [4]) financed by the UE and by the Italian Ministry of Research have allowed the development and the vast experimentation in the domain of Cultural Heritage preservation with different general purpose ML methods and tools. The proprietary systems WISDOM++ [5], ATRE [6], INTHELEX [7], DOMINUS [8] are characterized by the intensive exploitation of intelligent techniques in each step of the document processing, from the acquisition to the layout analysis, from classification to interpretation, from text categorization to semantic indexing for information retrieval purposes. For example, in the project Collate (Collaboratory for Annotation, Indexing and Retrieval of Digitized Historical Archive Material), which aimed to provide a support for archives, researchers and endusers, worked with digitized historic/cultural material. A large corpus of multi-format documents concerning rare historic film censorship forms from the 20's and 30's, fig.1 (a), but also including newspaper articles, photos, stills, posters and film fragments, provided by three major European Film archives, had to be processed. The application of different symbolic learning methods in the diverse phases of the automatic document processing, from the image document acquisition to the layout correction and analysis, from document classification to understanding, allowed to keep contents accessible in their integrity and intelligible according to their meaning. The possibility of understanding the content of a part of a document, basing on the layout, is reported In fig. 1, where an example of a censorship card is shown, with the automatically acquired rule for the recognition of the logic block of the film title, expressed in terms of position and relationships with other logical layout blocks. The application of symbolic ML methods allows to organize and classify documents, to cope with the incrementality and the need for continuous updating and refining classification theories and concepts, in order to improve accuracy according to new available documents. Techniques for text categorization and information extraction can be applied to selected blocks and provide information that can be added to the documents as metadata, in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the retrieval procedure. In document image understanding, the possibility of associating relevant text to underlying informative content allows to search documents at a semantic level rather than just at a syntactic one, in the perspective of the Semantic Web. © 2013 Author.",concept learning methods; incremental learning; inductive logic programming; semantic processing,Digital libraries; Distributed computer systems; Engineering education; Gateways (computer networks); Historic preservation; Indexing (of information); Inductive logic programming (ILP); Information retrieval; Intelligent systems; Knowledge engineering; Learning systems; Materials; Museums; Problem solving; Research; Societies and institutions; Technology transfer; Telecommunication systems; Text processing; Tools; World Wide Web; Concept learning; Content-based search and retrieval; Cultural heritage preservation; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Historical document processing; Incremental learning; Semantic processing; Statistical relational learning; Electronic document exchange,"INnovative Techniques for REcognition and ProcessIng of Documents, , ESPRIT project 5203 INTREPID; CONCEptual Indexing, Querying and ReTrieval of Digital DOcuments, , ESPRIT project 29159 CONCERTO; COLLAboratory for Annotation, Indexing and Retrieval of Digitized Historical Archive Materials, , IST project COLLATE 20882; (2006) Cultural Heritage Fruition & E-learning Applications of New Advanced (Multimodal) Technologies, , FAR Miur CHAT; Altamura, O., Esposito, F., Malerba, D., Transforming Paper Documents into XML format with WISDOM++ (2001) Int.

In our automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, prior to rule extraction, we first classify the text into pre-defined categories to only retrieve relevant clauses and filter out irrelevant ones, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of rule extraction. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been commonly-used for text classification (TC). ML-based TC has, generally, performed well. However, given the need for an exceptionally-high performance (100% recall and >85% precision) for ACC (to avoid consequent compliance reasoning errors), we need further performance improvement. Therefore, in this paper, we present an ontology-based TC algorithm to further improve the classification performance by utilizing the semantic features of the text. We used a domain ontology for conceptualizing the environmental knowledge. In comparison to the ML-based approach, in our ontology-based approach, a document (or clause) is represented in terms of semantic concepts and relations, rather than just terms (words). The semantic concepts and relations in the ontology (e.g. ""is-a"" relations) help in recognizing the semantic features of the text. Our ontology-based TC algorithm was tested on twelve environmental regulatory documents - such as the 2012 International Energy Conservation Code - evaluated in terms of precision and recall, and compared with our previously-utilized ML-based approach.

Our software prototype 1) applies Text Classification and Text Mining methods on vacancy announcements to decompose jobs into meaningful skills components, which lifelong learners should target; and 2) creates a hybrid OER Recommender System to suggest personalized learning content for learners to progress towards their skill targets. For the first evaluation of this prototype we focused on two job areas: Data Scientist, and Mechanical Engineer. We applied our skill extractor approach and provided OER recommendations for learners targeting these jobs. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 12 subject matter experts to learn how our prototype performs in terms of its objectives, logic, and contribution to learning. More than 150 recommendations were generated, and 76.9% of these recommendations were treated as useful by the interviewees. Interviews revealed that a personalized OER recommender system, based on skills demanded by labour market, has the potential to improve the learning experience of lifelong learners.

More than just replacing humans for 'dull, dirty and dangerous' work, autonomous agents are expected to cope with a whole host of uncertainties while working closely together with humans in new situations. The robotics revolution firmly established the primacy of Bayesian algorithms for tackling challenging perception, learning and decision-making problems. Since the next frontier of autonomy demands the ability to gather information across stretches of time and space that are beyond the reach of a single autonomous agent, the next generation of Bayesian algorithms must capitalize on opportunities to draw upon the sensing and perception abilities of humans-in/on-the-loop. This work summarizes our recent research toward harnessing 'human sensors' for information gathering tasks. The basic idea behind is to allow human end users (i.e. non-experts in robotics, statistics, machine learning, etc.) to directly 'talk to' the information fusion engine and perceptual processes aboard any autonomous agent. Our approach is grounded in rigorous Bayesian modeling and fusion of flexible semantic information derived from user-friendly interfaces, such as natural language chat and locative hand-drawn sketches. This naturally enables 'plug and play' human sensing with existing probabilistic algorithms for planning and perception, and has been successfully demonstrated with human-robot teams in target localization applications. © 2016 SPIE.",Bayesian methods; Collaborative sensing; Estimation; Human-machine systems; Machine learning; Robotics; Sensor fusion,Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Decision making; Drawing (graphics); Estimation; Intelligent robots; Learning systems; Man machine systems; Military applications; Modeling languages; Robot programming; Robotics; Robots; Semantics; Sensor networks; Space research; Bayesian methods; Collaborative sensing; Decision-making problem; Probabilistic algorithm; Robotic space exploration; Sensor fusion; User friendly interface; Wilderness search and rescues; Autonomous agents,"Miller, I., Campbell, M., Huttenlocher, D., Kline, F.-R., Nathan, A., Lupashin, S., Catlin, J., Zych, N., Team cornell's skynet: Robust perception and planning in an urban environment (2008) Journal of Field Robotics, 25 (8), pp. 493-527; Argrow, B., Frew, E., Elston, J., Stachura, M., Roadman, J., Houston, A., Lahowetz, J., The tempest uas: The vortex2 supercell thunderstorm penetrator (2011) InfotechAerospace, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA); Werner, D., Ambition: Europa (2016) Aerospace America Magazine, pp. 22-28. , June; Kingston, D., Intruder tracking using UAV teams and ground sensor networks (2012) German Aviation and Aerospace Conference, 2012. , DLRK 2012; Silver, D., Huang, A., Maddison, C.J., Guez, A., Sifre, L., Van Den Driessche, G., Schrittwieser, J., Lanctot, M., Mastering the game of go with deep neural networks and tree search (2016) Nature, 529 (7587), pp. 484-489; Sweet, N., Ahmed, N., Kuter, U., Miller, C., Towards self-con dence in autonomous systems (2016) AIAA InfoTechAtAerospace 2016; Aitken, M., Ahmed, N., Lawrence, D., Argrow, B., Frew, E., Assurances and machine self-condence for enhanced trust in autonomous systems (2016) RSS 2016 Workshop on Social Trust in Autonomous Systems; McGuire, S., Furlong, P., Heckman, C., Julier, S., Szar, D., Ahmed, N., Teamwork across the stars: Machine learning to overcome the brittleness of autonomy (2016) IROS 2016 Workshop on Human-Robot Collaboration: Towards Co-Adaptive Learning Through Semi-Autonomy and Shared Control; Miller, C., Goldman, R., Funk, H., Wu, P., Pate, B., A playbook approach to variable autonomy control: Application for control of multiple, heterogeneous unmanned air vehicles (2004) Proceedings of FORUM 60, the Annual Meeting of the American Helicopter Society, pp. 7-10; Lee, J.D., See, K.A., Trust in automation: Designing for appropriate reliance (2004) Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, 46 (1), pp. 50-80; Sheridan, T., (2002) Humans and Automation: System Design and Research Issues, , Wiley Santa Monica, CA; Tellex, S., Kollar, T., Dickerson, S., Walter, M.R., Banerjee, A.G., Teller, S., Roy, N., Approaching the symbol grounding problem with probabilistic graphical models (2011) AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Shah, D., Campbell, M., A robust qualitative path planner for mobile robot navigation using human-provided maps (2011) 2011 Intl.

This paper describes two approaches to an important form of legal decision support-explainable outcome prediction-that obviate both annotation of an entire decision corpus and manual processing of new cases. The first approach, which uses an Attention Network for prediction and attention weights to highlight salient case text, was shown to be capable of predicting decisions, but attention-weight-based text highlighting did not demonstrably improve human decision speed or accuracy in an evaluation with 61 human subjects. The second approach, termed SCALE (Semi-supervised Case Annotation for Legal Explanations), exploits structural and semantic regularities in case corpora to identify textual patterns that have both predictable relationships to case decisions and explanatory value. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Artificial intelligence & law; Computational models of argument; Human language technology; Legal reasoning; Machine learning,Artificial intelligence; Cost engineering; Engineering education; Forecasting; Learning systems; Semantics; Supervised learning; Computational model; Decision supports; Human language technologies; Legal reasoning; Maintenance cost; Manual processing; Outcome prediction; Semi-supervised method; Decision support systems,"Al-Abdulkarim, L., Atkinson, K., Bench-Capon, T.J.M., Whittle, S., Williams, R., Wolfenden, C., Noise induced hearing loss: An application of the angelic methodology (2017) Legal Knowledge and Information Systems - JURIX 2017: The Thirtieth Annual Conference, pp. 79-88. , Luxembourg, 13-15 December, 2017; Alarie, B., Niblett, A., Yoon, A., (2017) Using Machine Learning to Predict Outcomes in Tax Law, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2855977, December 15, or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn. 2855977; Aletras, N., Tsarapatsanis, D., Preotiuc-Pietro, D., Lampos, V., Predicting judicial decisions of the european court of human rights: A natural language processing perspective (2016) PeerJ CompSci, , https://peerj.com/articles/cs-93, October 24; Aleven, V., Ashley, K., Evaluating a learning environment for case-based argumentation skills (1997) Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 170-179. , ACM Press, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia June 30-July 3; Aleven, V.A.W.M.M., (1997) Teaching Case-based Argumentation through a Model and Examples, , Ph.

Meanwhile, discovering the evolution of character relations in an opera benefits many opera-oriented story exploration tasks. Aiming to automatically extract relations among opera characters, we demonstrate a prototype system named OperaMiner, which extracts relations for opera characters based on a hybrid deep neural network. The major features of OperaMiner are: (1) It provides a uniform reasoning framework for character relations considering language structure information as well as explicit and implicit expressions in opera scripts. (2) It explores the deep features in opera scripts, including character embeddings features, word embeddings features, and the linguistic features in artistic texts. (3) It presents a hybrid learning architecture enhancing CNN and Bi-LSTM with a CRF layer for character relation extraction. After a brief introduction to the architecture and key technologies of OperaMiner, we present a case study to demonstrate the main features of OperaMiner, including the generation of the character relation graph, the demonstration of major roles, and the evolution sequence of character relations. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Character relation; Deep learning; Opera scripts; Relation extraction,Bismuth compounds; Database systems; Deep learning; Embeddings; Extraction; Linguistics; Long short-term memory; Network architecture; Character relation; Exploration tasks; Hybrid learning architecture; Language structure; Linguistic features; Opera scripts; Reasoning framework; Relation extraction; Deep neural networks,"Kadry, A., Dietz, L., Open relation extraction for support passage retrieval: Merit and open issues (2017) SIGIR, pp. 1149-1152. , pp; Ma, X., Hovy, E., End-to-end sequence labeling via bi-directional LSTM-CNNs-CRF (2016) ACL, pp. 1064-1074. , pp; Chiu, J., Nichols, E., (2015) Named Entity Recognition with Bidirectional Lstm-Cnns.

The paper presents an artificial assistant designed to facilitate a reliable access to medical online contents. Interactions are modelled as doctor-patient Question Answering sessions within a preoperative patient education scenario where the system addresses patient's information needs explaining medical events and procedures. This implies an accurate medical information extraction from and reasoning with available medical knowledge and large amounts of unstructured multilingual online data. Bridging the gap between medical knowledge and data, we explore a language-agnostic approach to medical concepts mining from the standard terminologies, and the data-driven collection of the corresponding seed terms in a distant supervision setting for German. Experimenting with different terminologies, features and term matching strategies, we achieved a promising F-score of 0.91 on the medical term extraction task. The concepts and terms are used to search and retrieve definitions from the verified online free resources. The proof-of-concept definition retrieval system is designed and evaluated showing promising results, acceptable by humans in 92% of cases. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

Although typically small, such programs can be complex, involving problem decomposition, recursion, and recognition of context. Building such programs is common in commercial and academic data analytic projects and can be labour intensive and expensive, making it a suitable candidate for machine learning. In this paper, we use the meta-interpretive learning framework (MIL) to learn recursive data transformation programs from small numbers of examples. MIL is well suited to this task because it supports problem decomposition through predicate invention, learning recursive programs, learning from few examples, and learning from only positive examples. We apply Metagol, a MIL implementation, to both semi-structured and unstructured data. We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets: medical patient records, XML mondial records, and natural language taken from ecological papers. The experimental results suggest that high levels of predictive accuracy can be achieved in these tasks from small numbers of training examples, especially when learning with recursion. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,Artificial intelligence; Computer circuits; Learning systems; Metadata; Reconfigurable hardware; Data transformation; Ecological papers; Learning frameworks; Predictive accuracy; Problem decomposition; Real-world datasets; Recursive programs; Unstructured data; Inductive logic programming (ILP),"Aitken, J.S., Learning information extraction rules: An inductive logic programming approach (2002) ECAI, pp. 355-359; Berardi, M., Malerba, D., Learning recursive patterns for biomedical information extraction (2007) ILP 2006.

The latest publications on solving problems of recognition and analysis of texts by their images were analyzed, a selected range of application libraries for creating a program for experiments are Keras, TensorFlow, Theano, Pandas, Matplotlib and others. Two variants of recognition technology were analyzed and tested: using fuzzy logic and using deep learning neural networks. To construct and train neural networks, a well-known and rather complete base of handwritten digits MNIST was chosen. Two types of neural networks were considered: sequential and convolutional. The training of neural networks was carried out using a variable number of steps (epochs). Recognition images were scaled to a size of 28x28 (784 cells in a one-dimensional representation). Preliminary processing of images (filtering, scaling, etc.) was carried out using the OpenCV library. For recognition, each image of the digit was converted to a 28x28 size and fed to the input of a pre-trained neural network. A technique to select the area of interest in photographs containing hand-written digits for further recognition has been worked out.

This well-known mining technique is based on fuzzy set theory, which is used to model natural language words (e.g. 'many', 'tall'), and in result - generates natural-like sentences describing the data. Although intensely developed, before our work this method has been applied only to relational databases, while more and more data is available in graph model. A special case of such graph datasets is the Semantic Web, in which ontologies provide meaning, therefore enabling advanced machine learning. In our paper we analyze the problem of generating linguistic summaries for a graph data case (for which the method cannot be directly applied), with associated ontologies. The key element of ontologies are concept hierarchies, which are the core of our work. Firstly, due to heterogeneity and lack of schema we propose to use an ontological concept (including all sub-concepts in hierarchy) as a subject for summaries, and extract their attributes (neighboring vertexes). Then we show that by ascending these ontological concept hierarchies (so by attribute-based induction) we obtain additional, generalized summaries. We show this process for both summarizers and qualifiers, and propose an extension to their respective imprecision measures - T2 and T9. We perform two experiments on DBPedia - one for summary subject 'Artist', and second for 'Musical Album'. For the latter, we show the optimized process of obtaining the truth values using bottom-up approach. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

However, due to the complexity of medical diagnosis and medical research, there are still many unknown problems in this field. With the recent emphasis of the national government and academic agencies in open sharing data and advancement of computational tools, e.g. machine learning and artificial intelligence, there is a renewed hope to tackle such complex problems. One of the fields that can benefit greatly from such advancement is the cancer clinical trial matching. This field has gained a lot of attention due to its complexity and the large number of people it affects. The algorithms proposed in this paper aim to assist clinicians and patients in cancer clinical trial matching by reducing the number of eligible trials using a combination of logical conditions and text mining of trial descriptions. Data for this study is provided by the Clinical Trial website which consists of 100 patients’ demographic and clinical information. Our preliminary results demonstrate the capabilities of unsupervised learning and conditional logic in reducing the matched trials and suggest further exploration for improvement and optimization of clinical trial matching for clinicians. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Agglomerative clustering; Clinical trial matching; Jaccard similarity; Text mining; Unsupervised learning,Artificial intelligence; Data Sharing; Diseases; Medical problems; Text mining; Clinical information; Complex problems; Computational tools; Computer technology; Conditional logic; Medical research; National governments; Number of peoples; Diagnosis,"U.S. Cancer Statistics Data Visualizations Tool, Based on 2019 Submission Data (1999-2017), , U.S. department of health and human services, centers for disease control and prevention and national cancer institute; Weir, H.K., The past, present, and future of cancer incidence in the United States: 1975 through 2020 (2015) Cancer, 121 (11), pp. 1827-1837; Unger, J.M., The role of clinical trial participation in cancer research: Barriers, evidence, and strategies (2016) Am.

We exploit multiple levels of feature maps of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network, as well as contextualized word and sentence embeddings extracted from a character-based language model. Following dedicated non-linear mappings for visual features at each level, word, and sentence embeddings, we obtain multiple instantiations of our common semantic space in which comparisons between any target text and the visual content is performed with cosine similarity. We guide the model by a multi-level multimodal attention mechanism which outputs attended visual features at each level. The best level is chosen to be compared with text content for maximizing the pertinence scores of image-sentence pairs of the ground truth. Experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets show significant performance gains (20%-60% relative) over the state-of-the-art in phrase localization and set a new performance record on those datasets. We provide a detailed ablation study to show the contribution of each element of our approach and release our code on GitHub. © 2019 IEEE.",Deep Learning; Representation Learning; Vision + Language; Visual Reasoning,Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Embeddings; Semantics; Attention mechanisms; Cosine similarity; Nonlinear mappings; Performance Gain; Representation Learning; State of the art; Visual modalities; Visual reasoning; Visual languages,"Anderson, P., He, X., Buehler, C., Teney, D., Johnson, M., Gould, S., Zhang, L., Bottom-up and top-down attention for image captioning and visual question answering (2018) CVPR, 3, p. 6; Antol, S., Agrawal, A., Lu, J., Mitchell, M., Batra, D., Lawrence Zitnick, C., Parikh, D., Vqa: Visual question answering (2015) International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV); Chelba, C., Mikolov, T., Schuster, M., Ge, Q., Brants, T., Koehn, P., Robinson, T., One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling (2014) Fifteenth Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association; Chen, K., Gao, J., Nevatia, R., Knowledge aided consistency for weakly supervised phrase grounding (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Chen, K., Kovvuri, R., Gao, J., Nevatia, R., Msrc: Multimodal spatial regression with semantic context for phrase grounding (2018) International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval, 7 (1), pp. 17-28; Chen, K., Kovvuri, R., Nevatia, R., Query-guided regression network with context policy for phrase grounding (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV); Chen, L., Zhang, H., Xiao, J., Nie, L., Shao, J., Liu, W., Chua, T., Sca-cnn: Spatial and channel-wise attention in convolutional networks for image captioning (2017) 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 6298-6306. , IEEE; Deng, C., Wu, Q., Wu, Q., Hu, F., Lyu, F., Tan, M., Visual grounding via accumulated attention (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 7746-7755; Engilberge, M., Chevallier, L., Pérez, P., Cord, M., Finding beans in burgers: Deep semanticvisual embedding with localization (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3984-3993; Fang, H., Gupta, S., Iandola, F., Srivastava, R.K., Deng, L., Dollár, P., Gao, J., Platt, J.C., From captions to visual concepts and back (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1473-1482; Fukui, A., Huk Park, D., Yang, D., Rohrbach, A., Darrell, T., Rohrbach, M., Multimodal compact bilinear pooling for visual question answering and visual grounding (2016) Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing; Gordo, A., Almazán, J., Revaud, J., Larlus, D., Deep image retrieval: Learning global representations for image search (2016) European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 241-257. , Springer; Grubinger, M., Clough, P., Müller, H., Deselaers, T., The iapr tc-12 benchmark: A new evaluation resource for visual information systems (2006) Int.

Thus, human users and automatic tools alike have to traverse the pagination links when they crawl the site, extract data, or automate common tasks, where these applications require access to the entire result set. Previous approaches, as well as existing crawlers and automation tools, rely on simple heuristics (e.g., considering only the link text), falling back to an exhaustive exploration of the site where those heuristics fail. In particular, focused crawlers and data extraction systems target only fractions of the individual pages of a given site, rendering a highly accurate identification of pagination links essential to avoid the exhaustive exploration of irrelevant pages. We identify pagination links in a wide range of domains and sites with near perfect accuracy (99%). We obtain these results with a novel framework for web block classification, , that combines rule-based reasoning for feature extraction and machine learning for feature selection and classification. Through this combination, is applicable in a wide settings range, adjusted to maximise either precision, recall, or speed. We illustrate how minimises the effort for feature extraction and evaluate the impact of a broad range of features (content, structural, and visual). © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,Automatic tools; Automation tools; Block classification; Data extraction; Feature selection and classification; Focused crawler; Human users; Rule based reasoning; Screen sizes; Feature extraction; Internet; Websites,"Almpanidis, G., Kotropoulos, C., Pitas, I., Combining text and link analysis for focused crawling - An application for vertical search engines (2007) Inf.

In practice, however, the crowd often fails at generating innovative solutions, leading to duplicate or ideas that use each other's description. Thus, it is practically and economically unfeasible to sift through this large number of ideas to select valuable ones. One promising solution to overcome this issue is identifying relationships between idea text descriptions, such as duplicate, generalize, disjoint, alternative solution. Existing approaches rely either on human judgment, which is expensive and requires domain experts or automatic approaches which compute similarity i.e. one dimension and do not consider other relations. To find complex relationships between idea texts, a first logical step is to fully structure ideas into logic-based representation. However, logic-based representations are very expensive to obtain since ideas' texts do not adhere to any specific structure. Our goal is then to come up with a representation that can be learned by the machine, while still being expressive to allow establishing relationships between ideas. This research in progress introduces an approach based on a sequence-to-sequence learning approach, which allows the machine to learn a lightweight structural representation that is used next to establishing multidimensional relationships between ideas (i.e. different kind of relations between ideas). Based on our investigation, we found out that ideas contain the following patterns: what the idea is about (e.g. window with heat-sensitive material), how it works (e.g. it lights up) and when it works (e.g. in case of fire). Those extracted patterns are then compared with the corresponding patterns of other ideas to establish relations. Our preliminary investigation shows promising results to learn such lightweight structural representation and leverages it in identifying complex relationships between ideas. © 2020 IEEE.",Knowledge-extraction; Lightweight knowledge representation; Machine learning; Patterns discovery; Sequence to sequence learning,Computation theory; Semantics; Alternative solutions; Automatic approaches; Complex relationships; Heat-sensitive materials; Innovative solutions; Light-weight representation; Logic-based representation; Structural representation; Computer circuits,"Khiat, A., Mackeprang, M., Müller-Birn, C., (2018) Innovonto: An Enhanced Crowd Ideation Platform with Semantic Annotation (Hallway Test); Siangliulue, P., Chan, J., Dow, S.P., Gajos, K.Z., Ideahound: Improving large-scale collaborative ideation with crowd-powered realtime semantic modeling (2016) Proc. of the 29th UIST, pp. 609-624; Westerski, A., (2013) Semantic Technologies in Idea Management Systems: A Model for Interoperability, Linking and Filtering, , Ph.

Basically, OONP reads a document and parses it into a predesigned object-oriented data structure that reflects the domain-specific semantics of the document. An OONP parser models semantic parsing as a decision process: a neural net-based Reader sequentially goes through the document, and builds and updates an intermediate ontology during the process to summarize its partial understanding of the text. OONP supports a big variety of forms (both symbolic and differentiable) for representing the state and the document, and a rich family of operations to compose the representation. An OONP parser can be trained with supervision of different forms and strength, including supervised learning (SL), reinforcement learning (RL) and hybrid of the two. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world document parsing tasks have shown that OONP can learn to handle fairly complicated ontology with training data of modest sizes. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics",,Computational linguistics; Machine learning; Ontology; Reinforcement learning; Semantics; Decision process; Document understanding; Domain specific semantics; Object oriented; Object oriented data; Parser models; Semantic parsing; Training data; Object oriented programming,"Berners-Lee, T., Hendler, J., Lassila, O., The semantic web (2001) Scientific American, 284 (5), pp. 34-43; Buys, J., Blunsom, P., Robust incremental neural semantic graph parsing (2017) Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics(ACL), pp. 1215-1226; Fillmore Charles, J., Frame semantics (1982) Linguistics in the Morning Calm, pp. 111-137; Daumé, H., III, Langford, J., Marcu, D., Search-based structured prediction (2009) Machine Learning Journal (MLJ); Graves, A., Wayne, G., Danihelka, I., Neural turing machines (2014) CoRR, , abs/1410.5401; Henaff, M., Weston, J., Szlam, A., Bordes, A., LeCun, Y., Tracking the world state with recurrent entity networks (2017) ICLR; Henderson, M., Thomson, B., Young, S., Word-based dialog state tracking with recurrent neural networks (2014) Proceedings of the 15th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL), pp. 292-299; Herzig, J., Berant, J., Neural semantic parsing over multiple knowledge-bases (2017) Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics(ACL), pp. 623-628; Ji, Y., Tan, C., Martschat, S., Choi, Y., Smith, N.A., Dynamic entity representations in neural language models (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing(EMNLP), pp. 1830-1839. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Johnson, D.D., Learning graphical state transitions (2017) The International Conference on Learning Representations(ICLR); Jonathan, B., Percy, L., Semantic parsing via paraphrasing (2014) Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL); Liang, C., Berant, J., Le, Q., Forbus, K.D., Lao, N., Neural symbolic machines: Learning semantic parsers on freebase with weak supervision (2017) Association for Computational Linguistics(ACL); Liu, X., Mou, L., Cui, H., Lu, Z., Song, S., Jumper: Learning when to make classification decisions in reading (2018) IJCAI; Van Rijsbergen, C.J., (1979) Information Retrieval, , Butterworth-Heinemann, Newton, MA, USA, 2nd edition; Weston, J., Bordes, A., Chopra, S., Mikolov, T., Towards ai-complete question answering: A set of prerequisite toy tasks (2015) CoRR, , abs/1502.05698; Williams, R.J., Simple statistical gradient-following algorithms for connectionist reinforcement learning (1992) Machine Learning, 8, pp. 229-256; Yan, Y., Zheng, D., Lu, Z., Song, S., Event identification as a decision process with non-linear representation of text (2017) CoRR, , abs/1710.00969; Yang, Z., Blunsom, P., Dyer, C., Ling, W., Reference-aware language models (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing(EMNLP), pp. 1850-1859. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Yu, F., Koltun, V., Multi-scale context aggregation by dilated convolutions (2016) ICLR; Zeng, D., Liu, K., Lai, S., Zhou, G., Zhao, J., Relation classification via con-volutional deep neural network (2014) Proceedings of COLING",,Apple;ByteDance;et al.;Facebook;Google;Samsung Research,Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL),"Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL",15 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,,145927,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055678410

Over the past two decades, consumers have begun to use smart devices to both take in and generate a large volume of open-source text-based data, providing the opportunity for latent anomaly analysis. However, real-time data acquisition, and the processing and interpretation of various types of unstructured data, remains a great challenge. Recent efforts have focused on artificial intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) solutions to accelerate the labor-intensive linear collection, exploitation, and dissemination analysis cycle and enhance it with a data-driven rapid integration and correlation process of open-source data. This paper describes an Activity Based Intelligence framework for anomaly detection of open-source big data using AI/ML to perform semantic analysis. The proposed Anomaly Detection using Semantic Analysis Knowledge (ADUSAK) framework includes four layers: input layer, knowledge layer, reasoning layer, and graphical user interface (GUI)/output layer. The corresponding main technologies include: Information Extraction, Knowledge Graph (KG) construction, Semantic Reasoning, and Pattern Discovery. Finally, ADUSAK was verified by performing Emerging Events Detection, Fake News Detection, and Suspicious Network Analysis. The generalized ADUSAK framework can be easily extended to a wide range of applications by adjusting the data collection, modeling construction, and event alerting. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Subsequent processing machines like document retrieval, text summarization, search engines, rule based machines, expert systems have been developed. These machines have dedicated performance with retrieval measure in particular dimension. Machine learning methods have facilitated reasoning machine with ability like humans. Still a corner in research argues highly intelligent time constraint fact seeking real world information processing machine. Hybrid technology is integration of optimized approaches at various levels of information processing. We proposed a hybrid search answer machine with four techniques of optimization 'question reformulation' (from user-intent, profile), 'search method' (semantic concept, context, machine learning), 'answer presentation' (ranking algorithm), 'decision support ' (comparative analysis to choose best techniques to retrieve results). Data corpus is heart of any IR system large dataset facilitates good search which argue to distributed data and computing. Intelligence is reformation proceeds that excel our time and dataset. The machine is designed to facilitated updatable training dataset for fact seeking knowledge acquirement 'it trains over data'. Muti-agent model distributed search methodology is proposed. In precise Hybrid extraction of 'hybrid models' is performed. Semantic context (concept based) user profiled; best machine learning, decision supportive multiagent distributed search system is proposed. This paper gives underlying technologies overview, with examinations of 30 papers is done as with recent review of technology advancement. The review outcomes are orderly placed with 3 research query answering. The outputs of query structure a trail to search engine answering machine. We facilitate research done by scholars on technology perspective we integrate them to draw a sketch of hybrid search answering. In domain 'a point of reference' concepts of research are studied, with comparative views on advance in IR. We identify the benchmark of research methods blueprint and explore space of research in area of intelligent machine implementation. © 2015 IEEE.",Hybrid Intelligent Machine; Information retrieveal; Machine Intelligence; NLP; Search Engine,Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Decision support systems; Distributed computer systems; Drawing (graphics); Expert systems; Information retrieval; Information science; Learning systems; Semantics; Distributed search systems; Information retrieveal; Intelligent information; Intelligent machine; Machine intelligence; Machine learning methods; Real-world information; Review of technologies; Search engines,"Www.wikipedia.com; Mitchell, T.M., (1997) Machine Learning New York Mcgraw Hill; Vapnik, V., (1997) The Nature of Ststistical Learningtheory New York Springerverlag; Qing, Y., Qingx Li, W., Review on studies and advances of machine learningapproaches, telkomnika international (2014) Journal of Elevtrical Engineering; Vapnik, V., (1998) Ststistical Theory New York, , j wiley; Wang, W., Simple analysis on research applications of machine learning (2010) Computer Informationtechnology; Rajagopal, D., A Graph-Based Approach to CoMIMOnsense Concept Extraction and Semantic Similarity Detection; Young, M., (1989) The Technical Writer's Handbook, , Mill Valley, CA: University Science; Parameswaran, A., Towards the web of concepts: Extracting concepts from large datasets 2010 (2010) VLDB '10, , September 13-17; Priss, U., Verlag, P., Linguistic applications of formal concept analysis (2005) LNAI 3626, pp. 149-160. , Springer Verlag; Mdzingwa, N., Data mining with oracle 10g using clustering and classification algorithms xindongwu vipin kumar j.

Learning this notation typically requires many years of experience and is not an explicit part of undergraduate academic curricula. Constructing and comprehending logical predicates can feel difficult and unintuitive. We hypothesized that this process can be automated using neural machine translation. Most machine translation techniques involve word-based segmentation as a preprocessing step. Given the nature of our custom dataset, hosts first-order-logic (FOL) semantics primarily in unigram tokens, the word-based approach does not seem applicable. The proposed solution was to automate the translation of short English sentences into FOL expressions using character-level prediction in a recurrent neural network model. We trained four encoder-decoder models (LSTM, Bidirectional GRU with Attention, and two variants of Bi-directional LSTM with Attention). Our experimental results showed that several established neural translation techniques can be implemented to produce highly accurate machine translators of English sentences to FOL formalisms, given only characters as markers of semantics. We also demonstrated that attention-based enhancement to the encoder-decoder architecture can vastly improve translation accuracy.

In particular, custom topic models can be developed to answer specific research questions. The design of these models requires a non-trivial amount of effort and expertise, motivating general-purpose topic modeling frameworks. In this paper we introduce latent topic networks, a flexible class of richly structured topic models designed to facilitate applied research. Custom models can straightforwardly be developed in our framework with an intuitive first-order logical probabilistic programming language. Latent topic networks admit scalable training via a parallelizable EM algorithm which leverages ADMM in the M-step.

WordNet is an excellent relational dictionary, but it lacks deep semantic topology function because of its index-based text storage structure. As a graphical database, Neo4J provides visualization of its internal data. Since the abstract data structure in WordNet matches Neo4J’s ternary storage structure, it is very suitable to map WordNet completely with Neo4J graph instance. This paper studies how to fully describe WordNet in Neo4J through a ternary structure. Neo4J stores the data as graphs (nodes and edges) and provides certain native graph algorithms to search the data. The speed of matching query between nodes is varying linearly with the number of nodes, so the efficiency of basic operation is guaranteed. With the help of Neo4J, VSRDM works as a semantic dictionary providing relationships matching, reasoning auxiliary and other functions. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.",Knowledge-Driven; Neo4J; Semantic relations; WordNet,Abstracting; Data visualization; Digital storage; Graph Databases; Machine learning; Query processing; Semantics; Abstract data structures; Automatic inference; Knowledge-Driven; Neo4J; Semantic dictionaries; Semantic relations; Storage structures; Wordnet; Ontology,"Miller, G.A., WordNet: A lexical database for English (1995) Commun.

While humans complement interpretations of others' faces with additional reasoning about context, automated approaches rarely display such context-sensitivity. Empirical findings indicate that the personal memories triggered by videos are crucial for predicting viewers' emotional response to such videos ?- in some cases, even more so than the video's audiovisual content. In this article, we explore the benefits of personal memories as context for facial behavior analysis. We conduct a series of multimodal machine learning experiments combining the automatic analysis of video-viewers' faces with that of two types of context information for affective predictions: \beginenumerate∗[label=(\arabic∗)] \item self-reported free-text descriptions of triggered memories and \item a video's audiovisual content \endenumerate∗. Our results demonstrate that both sources of context provide models with information about variation in viewers' affective responses that complement facial analysis and each other. © 2020 ACM.",affect detection; context-awareness; emotion recognition,Audiovisual; Forecasting; Interactive computer systems; Affective response; Audio-visual content; Automated approach; Automatic analysis; Context information; Context sensitivity; Emotional response; Empirical findings; Modal analysis,"Baccianella, S., Esuli, A., Sebastiani, F., Sentiwordnet 3. 0: An enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2010) Lrec, 10, pp. 2200-2204; Baltrusaitis, T., Zadeh, A., Lim, Y.C., Morency, L., Openface 2. 0: Facial behavior analysis toolkit (2018) 2018 13th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2018), pp. 59-66. , https://doi.org/10.1109/FG.2018.00019; Barrett, L.F., Adolphs, R., Marsella, S., Martinez, A.M., Pollak, S.D., Emotional expressions reconsidered: Challenges to inferring emotion from human facial movements (2019) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 20 (1), pp. 1-68. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1529100619832930, jul 2019; Bartsch, A., Emotional gratification in entertainment experience (2012) Why Viewers of Movies and Television Series Find It Rewarding to Experience Emotions.

Derived services of digital music, such as recommendation systems and similarity test, then become essential for online services and marketing essentials. As a building block of these systems, music genre classification is necessary to support all these services. Previously, researchers mostly focused on low-level features, few of them viewed this problem from a more interpretable way, i.e., a musicological approach. This creates the problem that intermediate stages of the classification process are hardly interpretable, not much of music professionals' domain knowledge was therefore useful in the process. This paper approaches genre classification in a musicological way. The proposed method takes into consideration the high-level features that have clear musical meanings, so that music professionals would find the classification results interpretable. To examine more musicological elements other than additional statistical information, we use a dataset of only symbolic piano works, including more than 200 records of classical, jazz, and ragtime music. Feature extraction and n-gram text classification algorithm are performed. The proposed method proves its concept with experimental results achieving the prediction accuracy averaged above 90%, and with a peak of 98%. We believe that this novel method opens a door to allow music professional to contribute their expert knowledge meaningfully in the music genre classification process, the proposed approach would contribute significantly for future music classification and recommendation systems. © 2017 IEEE.",classification; machine learning; music; n-gram,Classification (of information); Learning systems; Online systems; Recommender systems; Classification process; Classification results; Genre classification; music; Music classification; Music genre classification; N-grams; Statistical information; Text processing,"Casey, M.A., Veltkamp, R., Goto, M., Leman, M., Rhodes, C., Slaney, M., Content-based music information retrieval: Current directions and future challenges (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE, 96 (4), pp. 668-696; Chou, C.-H., Liao, B.-J., Music genre classification by analyzing the subband spectrogram (2014) Information Science, Electronics and Electrical Engineering (ISEEE) 2014 International Conference on, 3, pp. 1677-1680. , IEEE; Alexandridis, A., Chondrodima, E., Paivana, G., Stogiannos, M., Zois, E., Sarimveis, H., Music genre classification using radial basis function networks and particle swarm optimization (2014) Computer Science and Electronic Engineering Conference (CEEC) 2014 6th, pp. 35-40. , IEEE; McKay, C., Fujinaga, I., Automatic genre classification using large high-level musical feature sets (2004) ISMIR, 2004, pp. 525-530; Jsymbolic: A feature extractor for midi files (2006) Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference, pp. 302-305; Li, M., Sleep, R., Melody classification using a similarity metric based on kolmogorov complexity (2004) Sound and Music Computing, pp. 126-129; Urbano, J., Lloŕens, J., Morato, J., Śanchez-Cuadrado, S., Melodic similarity through shape similarity (2011) Exploring Music Contents, pp. 338-355. , Springer; Kotsifakos, A., Kotsifakos, E.E., Papapetrou, P., Athitsos, V., Genre classification of symbolic music with smbgt (2013) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments, p. 44. , ACM; Hillewaere, R., Manderick, B., Conklin, D., String methods for folk tune genre classification (2012) ISMIR, 2012, p. 13th; Anglade, A., Ramirez, R., Dixon, S., First-order logic classification models of musical genres based on harmony (2009) 6th Sound and Music Computing Conference, pp. 309-314; Genre classification using harmony rules induced from automatic chord transcriptions (2009) ISMIR, pp. 669-674; Ṕerez-Garća, T., Ṕerez-Sancho, C., Iñesta, J.M., Harmonic and instrumental information fusion for musical genre classification (2010) Proceedings of 3rd International Workshop on Machine Learning and Music ACM, pp. 49-52; Ṕerez-Sancho, C., Rizo, D., Iñesta, J.M., De Léon, P.J.P., Kersten, S., Ramirez, R., Genre classification of music by tonal harmony (2010) Intelligent Data Analysis, 14 (5), pp. 533-545; Simsekli, U., Automatic music genre classification using bass lines (2010) Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2010 20th International Conference on, pp. 4137-4140. , IEEE; Manning, C.D., Raghavan, P., Schütze, H., (2008) Introduction to Information Retrieval, 1. , Cambridge university press Cambridge; Krueger, B., (2015) Classical Piano Midi Page, , http://www.piano-midi.de/; McKenzie, D., (2012) Doug Mckenzie Jazz Piano, , http://www.bushgrafts.com/jazz/midi.htm; Trachtman, W., (2011) Warren Trachtmans Ragtime Midi Website, , http://www.trachtman.org/ragtime/; (2015) Music21: A Toolkit for Computer-Aided Musicology, , http://web.mit.edu/music21/, MIT; (2015) Scikit-learn: Machine Learning",,,IEEE,"7th IEEE International Advanced Computing Conference, IACC 2017",5 January 2017 through 7 January 2017,,129044,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027030142

Hence, even well-established Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems, such as Abby, OCRopus, Tesseract, etc., fail to give sufficient recognition accuracy for historical archives, since they are optimized for transcribing contemporary documents. In contrast, the open-source anyOCR system is designed specifically for digitizing historical documents with state-of-the-art image processing techniques, to achieve high accuracy. Nowadays, the retrieval of historical document images for further OCR requires special scanning devices that are bulky and stationary. As a result, a portable device that combines scanning and OCR capabilities is beneficial to transcribe documents without the need to remove them from where they are archived. For example, smart goggles equipped with embedded OCR device can be used for instant word spotting. However, the available anyOCR software implementation has long runtime and high power consumption. As a solution, we propose a low power, energy-efficient accelerator with real-time capabilities called iDocChip, which is a hybrid hardware-software programmable System-on-Chip (SoC) for digitizing historical documents. This chip can be easily integrated in a portable device. This paper focuses on one of the most crucial processing steps in anyOCR: Text line extraction. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first hybrid hardware-software architecture of the text line extraction technique implemented on an FPGA based programmable SoC. The resulting custom hardware accelerator outperforms the existing anyOCR software implementation by 120x, while achieving 1700x higher energy efficiency without affecting the high accuracy of the system. © 2019 IEEE.",FPGA;

This is problematic not only for lack of transparency, but also for possible biases inherited by the algorithms from human prejudices and collection artifacts hidden in the training data, which may lead to unfair or wrong decisions. We focus on the urgent open challenge of how to construct meaningful explanations of opaque AI/ML systems, introducing the local-to-global framework for black box explanation, articulated along three lines: (i) the language for expressing explanations in terms of logic rules, with statistical and causal interpretation; (ii) the inference of local explanations for revealing the decision rationale for a specific case, by auditing the black box in the vicinity of the target instance; (iii), the bottom-up generalization of many local explanations into simple global ones, with algorithms that optimize for quality and comprehensibility. We argue that the local-first approach opens the door to a wide variety of alternative solutions along different dimensions: a variety of data sources (relational, text, images, etc.), a variety of learning problems (multi-label classification, regression, scoring, ranking), a variety of languages for expressing meaningful explanations, a variety of means to audit a black box. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

One of the most important facts is to read the news over the internet by using different social media applications. There are so many apps and websites as we see on the internet today that will be providing the news with proper authentication factors. But there is one question in everyone's minds that the news that is rolling over the internet is fake or true. Most of the news is always roll over the social media application like Facebook, Twitter, and sometimes on WhatsApp. There are two sides to using social media for news consumption. On the one side, people are attracted to social media because of its low cost, ease of access, and speed at which content is disseminated. On the other hand, it facilitates the spread of fake news, or low-quality news containing deliberately deceptive information. The mass distribution of false information has the potential to be extremely dangerous to individuals and society. As a result, spotting fake news on social media has emerged as a hot new research subject. Fake news monitoring on social media has distinct appearances and features, leaving outdated identification algorithms unreliable or obsolete. First, fake news is intentionally written to lead viewers to accept misleading facts, making it impossible and time-consuming to spot based on news content; as a result, we must have supporting data, such as using social networking interactions on social media, to help in decision-making. Second, as users' social experiences with fake news produce data that is massive, unreliable, shapeless, and noisy, misusing this auxiliary data is motivating in and of itself. We commissioned this survey to assist researchers in better understanding the difficulty of identifying fake news on social media, which is both complex and important. We will also like to discuss related research areas, open topics, and future research ideas for spotting false news on social media. It is very violated towards society to saw such fake news over the internet that is going to happen every day. Our paper will help to detect fake news with the use of python and some machine learning algorithm. It will tell the user that the news that is on the internet is fake or real by using SVM. Our model is working perfectly with good efficiency over the trained dataset. © 2021 IEEE.",Fuzzy logic; Machine Learning Algorithm; Naive Bayes Algorithm; Natural Language Processing; Support Vector Machine(SVM),Behavioral research; Decision making; Learning systems; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; User experience; Auxiliary data; Deceptive information; Identification algorithms; Low qualities; Mass distribution; News content; Research subjects; Social media; Learning algorithms,"Granik, M., Mesyura, V., Fake news detection using naive Bayes classifier (2017) 2017 IEEE 1st Ukr.

However, the reasoning behind the state-of-the-art black-box learning and prediction models has become obscured and this resultant lack of transparency has presented a problem whereby physicians are unable to trust the results of these systems. This motivated us to improve the conventional CAD with a more robust and interpretable algorithms to produce a system that achieves high accuracy and explainable diagnoses of lung cancer. The proposed approach uses a novel image processing pipeline to segment nodules from lung CT scan images, and then classifies the nodule using both 2D and 3D Alexnet models that have been trained on lung nodule data from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The explainability aspect is approached from two angles: 1) LIME that produces a visual explanation of the diagnosis, and 2) a rule-based system that produces a text-based explanation of the diagnosis. Overall, the proposed algorithm has achieved better performance and advance the practicality of CAD systems. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Cancer detection; Deep learning; Explainable AI; Image processing; Machine vision,Biological organs; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer vision; Diseases; Image segmentation; Intelligent robots; Lime; Medical imaging; Predictive analytics; Robotics; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); High-accuracy; Image processing pipeline; Lung Cancer; Lung cancer detections; Lung nodule; Prediction model; State of the art; Computerized tomography,"Tech.

However, efficient implementation suffers from very sequential execution that tremendously slows down both training and inference compared to other neural networks. This is the primary reason that prevents intensive research involving MD-LSTM in the recent years, despite large progress in microelectronics and architectures. The main goal of the current research is to provide acceleration for inference of MD-LSTM, so to open a door for efficient training that can boost application of MD-LSTM. By this research we advocate that FPGA is an alternative platform for deep learning that can offer a solution in cases when a massive parallelism of GPUs does not provide the necessary performance required by the application. In this paper, we present the first hardware architecture for MD-LSTM. We conduct a systematic exploration of precision vs. accuracy trade-off using challenging dataset for historical document image binarization from DIBCO 2017 contest, and well known MNIST dataset for handwritten digits recognition. Based on our new architecture we implement FPGA-based accelerator that outperforms NVIDIA K80 GPU implementation in terms of runtime by up to 50× and energy efficiency by up to 746×. At the same time, our accelerator demonstrates higher accuracy and comparable throughput in comparison with state-of-the-art FPGA-based implementations of multilayer perceptron for MNIST dataset. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",2D-LSTM; Deep Learning; DIBCO; FPGA; Hardware Architecture; Image Binarization; Long Short-Term Memory; LSTM; MD-LSTM; MNIST; Zynq,Arts computing; Brain; Character recognition; Deep learning; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Graphics processing unit; Logic gates; Medical imaging; Memory architecture; Microelectronics; Network architecture; Program processors; 2D-LSTM; DIBCO; Hardware architecture; Image binarization; LSTM; MNIST; Zynq; Long short-term memory,"http://pytorch.org/, [n. d.]; https://xilinxwikiatlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18841813/Zynq+UltraScale+MP\SoC+Power+Management, [n. d.].

Cluster analysis, based on some criteria, shares data into important, practical or both categories (clusters) based on shared common characteristics. In research, clustering and classification have been used to analyze data, in the field of machine learning, bioinformatics, statistics, pattern recognition to mention a few. Different methods of clustering include Partitioning (K-means), Hierarchical (AGNES), Density-based (DBSCAN), Grid-based (STING), Soft clustering (FANNY), Model-based (SOM) and Ensemble clustering. Challenges and problems in clustering arise from large datasets, misinterpretation of results and efficiency/performance of clustering algorithms, which is necessary for choosing clustering algorithms. In this paper, application of data clustering was systematically discussed in view of the characteristics of the different clustering techniques that make them better suited or biased when applied to several types of data, such as uncertain data, multimedia data, graph data, biological data, stream data, text data, time series data, categorical data and big data. The suitability of the available clustering algorithms to different application areas was presented. Also investigated were some existing cluster validity methods used to evaluate the goodness of the clusters produced by the clustering algorithms. © 2019 IEEE.",cluster analysis; cluster validity; Clustering; clustering algorithms; model-based clustering,Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Computer aided diagnosis; Large dataset; Pattern recognition; Application area; Cluster validity; Clustering; Clustering techniques; Ensemble clustering; ITS applications; Model-based clustering; Time-series data; K-means clustering,"Jain, A.K., Data clustering: 50 years beyond K-means (2010) Pattern Recognit.

Several methods based on Machine Learning are currently available, even if their precision is still outperformed by med- ical doctors. In this field there are some intrinsic limitations to ML ap- proaches, such as the cost and time to acquire high quality annotated scans for training; a considerably high variability of organs morphol- ogy due to age, health conditions, genetics; acquisition noise. This pa- per outlines a new methodology based on Answer Set Programming, which returns reliable, easy-to-program and explainable interpretations. In particular, we focus on the CT scan analysis and retrieval of tree-like structure, corresponding to main blood vessels (arteries) arrangement. The structure is compared to the knowledge base of vessels contained in anatomy text-books. The mapping of vessels names is computed by an ASP program.

The peculiarity of this approach is that it addresses a triple challenge: (1) the concepts used for labeling have no direct terminology in the documents, (2) their formal definitions are not initially known, (3) the information useful to label the documents is not necessarily mentioned in them. To solve those problems, we propose to use an existing ontology of the domain of concern and to enrich it with the definitions of the concepts used for labeling. To construct these definitions, we work on a set of manually labeled documents, used as examples. The ontology is populated with information extracted from these documents, and with information coming from external resources (Linked Open Data). The definitions that we want to get can then be learned based on this populated ontology and on the set of labeled documents. Learned definitions are then added to the ontology (ontology enrichment). Hence, whenever new documents of the same domain have to be labeled, the ontology can be populated in the same way and definitions apply, allowing the new documents to be labeled. This approach, named Saupodoc, is a novel approach to ontology population and enrichment, exploiting the foundations of the Semantic Web by combining contributions of text analysis, linked open data extraction, machine learning and reasoning tools. An evaluation, on two application domains, provides quality results and demonstrates the interest of the approach. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",,,"Alec, C., Reynaud-Delaître, C., Safar, B., A model for linked open data acquisition and SPARQL query generation (2016) Graph-Based Modeling of Conceptual Structures. 22Nd International Conference on Conceptual Structures, ICCS, pp. 237-251. , Annecy, France: Springer; Bontcheva, K., Tablan, V., Maynard, D., Cunningham, H., Evolving GATE to meet new challenges in language engineering (2004) Natural Language Engineering, 10 (3-4), pp. 349-373; Cheng, X., Roth, D., (2013) Relational Inference for Wikification.

Tremendous value lies in automated analysing and reasoning about such data in order to derive meaningful insights, which carries potential opportunities for businesses, users, and consumers. However, the sheer volume, noise, and dynamism of Twitter, imposes challenges that hinder the efficacy of observing clusters with high intra-cluster (i.e. minimum variance) and low inter-cluster similarities. This review focuses on research that has used various clustering algorithms to analyse Twitter data streams and identify hidden patterns in tweets where text is highly unstructured. This paper performs a comparative analysis on approaches of unsupervised learning in order to determine whether empirical findings support the enhancement of decision support and pattern recognition applications. A review of the literature identified 13 studies that implemented different clustering methods. A comparison including clustering methods, algorithms, number of clusters, dataset(s) size, distance measure, clustering features, evaluation methods, and results was conducted. The conclusion reports that the use of unsupervised learning in mining social media data has several weaknesses. Success criteria and future directions for research and practice to the research community are discussed. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.",Clustering; Data Mining; Machine Learning; Social Network Analysis; Twitter,Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Decision support systems; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Social networking (online); Unsupervised learning; Clustering; Comparative analysis; Empirical findings; Evaluation methods; Online social networks (OSN); Research communities; Social media datum; Twitter; Clustering algorithms,"Aggarwal, C.C., Zhai, C., (2012) Mining Text Data, , Springer Science & Business Media; Babu, A., Efficient density based clustering of tweets and sentimental analysis based on segmentation (2016) International Journal of Computer Techniques, 3, pp. 53-57; Baralis, E., Cerquitelli, T., Chiusano, S., Grimaudo, L., Xiao, X., Analysis of twitter data using a multiple-level clustering strategy International Conference on Model and Data Engineering, 2013, pp. 13-24. , Springer; Bora, D.J., Gupta, D., Kumar, A., (2014) A Comparative Study between Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm and Hard Clustering Algorithm, , Arxiv Preprint Arxiv:1404.6059; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Machine Learning, 45, pp. 5-32; Castillo, C., Mendoza, M., Poblete, B., Information credibility on twitter (2011) Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 675-684. , ACM; De Boom, C., Van Canneyt, S., Dhoedt, B., Semantics-driven event clustering in twitter feeds (2015) Making Sense of Microposts, , Ceur, 2-9; Ester, M., Kriegel, H.-P., Sander, J., Xu, X., A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise (1996) KDD, pp. 226-231; Friedemann, V., (2015) Clustering A Customer Base Using Twitter Data; Go, A., Bhayani, R., Huang, L., Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision (2009) Cs224n Project Report, Stanford, 1, p. 12; Godfrey, D., Johns, C., Meyer, C., Race, S., Sadek, C., (2014) A Case Study in Text Mining: Interpreting Twitter Data from World Cup Tweets, , Arxiv Preprint Arxiv:1408.5427; Han, J., Pei, J., Kamber, M., (2011) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, , Elsevier; Ifrim, G., Shi, B., Brigadir, I., Event detection in twitter using aggressive filtering and hierarchical tweet clustering (2014) Second Workshop on Social News on the Web (Snow), , Seoul, Korea, 8 April 2014, ACM; Hierarchical grouping to optimize an objective function (1963) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 58, pp. 236-244; Kaufman, L., Rousseeuw, P.J., (2009) Finding Groups in Data: An Introduction to Cluster Analysis, , John Wiley & Sons; Kaur, N., (2015) A Combinatorial Tweet Clustering Methodology Utilizing Inter and Intra Cosine Similarity, , (Doctoral Dissertation, Faculty Of Graduate Studies And Research, University Of Regina); Krestel, R., Werkmeister, T., Wiradarma, T.P., Kasneci, G., Tweet-recommender: Finding relevant tweets for news articles (2015) Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 53-54. , ACM; Kumar, S., Morstatter, F., Liu, H., (2014) Twitter Data Analytics, , Springer; Kaur, M., Comparison between k-mean and hierarchical algorithm using query redirection (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering, 3, pp. 54-59; Miyamoto, S., Suzuki, S., Clustering, T.S., In tweets using a fuzzy neighborhood model.

The K-CAP conference series provides a forum that brings together members of several research communities and practitioners who are interested in efficiently capturing knowledge from a variety of sources and in creating representations that can be useful for automated reasoning, analysis, and other forms of machine processing. Therefore, research in knowledge capture is at the intersection of areas such as knowledge engineering, machine learning, big data, natural-language processing, human-computer interaction, Artificial Intelligence, and the Semantic Web. K-CAP 2012 follows on the success of six previous conferences in 2011 (Banff, Alberta Canada), 2009 (Los Angeles, California, USA), 2007 (Whistler, British Columbia, Canada), in 2005 (Banff, Alberta, Canada), in 2003 (Sanibel Island, Florida, USA), and 2001 (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), and of the series of Knowledge Acquisition Workshops (KAW), the first of which took place in the same location (Banff, Alberta, Canada) in 1986. The theme of this seventh edition of K-CAP is: Knowledge Capture in the Age of Massive Web Data, reflecting the times we are living in. The call for papers attracted 60 submissions from Europe, America, Asia, and Oceania. The program committee accepted 13 full papers, 4 short papers and 3 application papers, that cover a variety of topics, including ontology engineering, ontology learning, linked open data, information extraction for knowledge capture, and knowledge capture from web data including online textual and multimedia resources. In addition, this volume includes descriptions of 8 posters and demos presented at the conference. In this seventh edition of the conference we have tried to innovate in several ways Rather than only aiming at research papers, we introduced an applications track for practitioners to present application-oriented contributions. We issued a call for participation for the first K-CAP ""Datathon"", a ""hackaton"" based on Open Data. Acknowledging the worldwide economic down turn, and the pressure many research and company budgets are suffering, we set up a crowdfunding initiative to help K-CAP 2013 with extra funds (http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/k-cap- 2013). Through this initiative as well as through a standard sponsoring program, we have tried to keep the participation costs as low as possible.",,"Application-oriented; Automated reasoning; British Columbia , Canada; Knowledge capture; Machine processing; Multimedia resources; Ontology engineering; Research communities; Application programs; Intelligent systems; Knowledge representation; Multimedia systems; Paper; Research","Edesign, , http://www.pbl.nl/e-design/","Computer Science, Netherlands",ACM SIGART,,"7th International Conference on Knowledge Capture: ""Knowledge Capture in the Age of Massive Web Data"", K-CAP 2013",23 June 2013 through 26 June 2013,"Banff, AB",98620,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883057125

In some cases, there could be just one sample. So, the defense system at the firing line must be able to quickly detect many automatically generated variants using a single malware instance observed from the initial outbreak by statically inspecting the binary executables. As previous research works show, statistical features such as term frequency-inverse document frequency and n-gram are significantly vulnerable to attacks by mutation through reinforcement learning. Recent studies focus on raw binary executable as a base feature which contains instructions describing the core logic of the sample. However, many approaches using image-matching neural networks are insufficient due to the malware mutation technique that generates a large number of samples with high entropy data. Deriving instruction cognitive representation that disambiguates legitimate instructions from the context is necessary for accurate detection over raw binary executables. In this paper, we present a novel method of detecting semantically similar malware variants within a campaign using a single raw binary malware executable. We utilize Discrete Fourier Transform of instruction cognitive representation extracted from self-attention transformer network. The experiments were conducted with in-the-wild malware samples from ransomware and banking Trojan campaigns. The proposed method outperforms several state of the art binary classification models. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Deep learning; Instruction recognition; One to many malware; Outbreak detection; Raw binary executable; Self-attention transformer,Discrete Fourier transforms; Inverse problems; Reinforcement learning; Text processing; Automatically generated; Binary classification; Binary executables; Number of samples; Outbreak detection; State of the art; Statistical features; Term frequency-inverse document frequencies; Malware,"Saxe, J., Berlin, K., Deep neural network based malware detection using two dimensional binary program features (2015) 2015 10th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALWARE).

It's very tedious for a service consumer to select the appropriate one according to her/his needs. In this paper, we propose a non-logic-based matchmaking approach that uses the Correlated Topic Model (CTM) to extract topic from semantic service descriptions and model the correlation between the extracted topics. Based on the topic correlation, service descriptions can be grouped into hierarchical clusters. In our approach, we use the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) formalism to organize the constructed hierarchical clusters into concept lattices according to their topics. Thus, service discovery may be achieved more easily using the concept lattice. In our approach, topic models are used as efficient dimension reduction techniques, which are able to capture semantic relationships between word-topic and topic-service interpreted in terms of probability distributions. In our experiment, we compared the accuracy of the our hierarchical clustering algorithm with that of a classical hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The comparisons of Precision@n and Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCGn) values for our approach, Apache lucene and SAWSDL-MX2 Matchmaker indicate that the method based on CTM presented in this paper outperform all the others matchmakers in terms of ranking of the most relevant services. © 2014 IEEE.",Data representation; Discovery and ranking; Formal Concept Analysis; Hierarchical clustering; Machine learning; Topic models; Web service,Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Hierarchical systems; Information analysis; Learning systems; Probability distributions; Semantics; Social networking (online); Text processing; Web services; Websites; Data representations; Dimension reduction techniques; Discovery and ranking; Formal concept analyses (FCA); Hier-archical clustering; Hierarchical agglomerative clustering; Hierarchical clustering algorithms; Topic model; Formal concept analysis,"Andrade, R.F.S., Miranda, J.G.V., Lobão, T.P., Neighborhood properties of complex networks (2006) Physical Review E, 73, p. 046101; Atkinson, C., Bostan, P., Hummel, O., Stoll, D., A practical approach to web service discovery and retrieval (2007) ICWS; Azmeh, Z., Huchard, M., Tibermacine, C., Urtado, C., Using concept lattices to support Web service compositions with backup services (2010) Proc. of ICIW'10; Aznag, M., Quafafou, M., Jarir, Z., Correlated topic model for Web services ranking (2013) IJACSA, 4 (6), pp. 283-291. , July; Aznag, M., Quafafou, M., El Rochd, M., Jarir, Z., Probabilistic topic models for Web services clustering and discovery (2013) ESOCC, LNCS 8135, pp. 19-33. , 11 September; Blei, D., Lafferty, J.D., A correlated topic model of science (2007) AAS, pp. 17-35; Cassar, G., Barnaghi, P., Moessner, K., Probabilistic matchmaking methods for automated service discovery IEEE TSC'2013; Gibbs, A.L., Francis, Edward, S., On choosing and bounding probability metrics (2002) Internat.
