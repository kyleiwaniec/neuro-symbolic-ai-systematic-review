This Repo Organization
----------------------

-   **Scopus**

    -   **Data** - where all the CSV files live, as well some additional txt and
        json

    -   **EDA-working-files** - these are intermediate files generated by EDA
        functions - nothing to see here

    -   **images** - images referenced in the notebooks

    -   **Supplemental-materials** - notebooks documenting the review process.
        
    -   **utils.py** - some functions used in the notebooks so the notebooks
        don’t get too cluttered

-   **figures** - for the review itself. These get uploaded to Overleaf

-   **Surveys** - existing NeSy surveys and discussion (not a comprehensive
    list)
